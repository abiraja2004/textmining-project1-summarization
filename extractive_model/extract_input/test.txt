london , where pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days , a phalanx of british lawyers argued before the high court of justice that the arrest order sent from spain was illegal

association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap , a proposal the owners said they would respond to by friday . </s><s> `` we tried our best today to try to do what was possible to salvage the season , '' said alonzo mourning , the miami heat center . </s><s> `` unfortunately , it did n't work out . '' </s><s> after 35,001 games without a blemish , the nba now joins the national hockey league , the national football league and major league baseball in having lost games to a labor dispute . </s><s> taking into account that a three to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts , the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations . </s><s> `` i 'm very sad and disappointed , '' said the nba commissioner , david stern . </s><s> `` i consider it to be a collective failure , but i honestly do n't know what else we could have done . </s><s> i do things that i like to think are in the best interests of the game . </s><s> and i believe this is . '' </s><s> the decision came after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player july 1 . </s><s> seventeen players , including union president patrick ewing and vice presidents mitch richmond , herb williams , dikemebe mutombo and ty corbin , attended the meeting along with stern , granik and five members of the ownership committee _ madison square garden president dave checketts and owners abe pollin of washington , gordon gund of cleveland , les alexander of houston and jerry colangelo of phoenix . </s><s> the talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league 's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners . </s><s> the dispute involves the distribution of approximately $ 2 billion in league-wide income . </s><s> the main sticking point has been the owners ' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions , the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries ' in line with revenue growth . </s><s> while the players did not discuss the elimination of the larry bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation proposal . </s><s> the main points were as follows : _ a 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $ 18 million , a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their bird rights . </s><s> for example , if a player made $ 20 million , the team would be forced to put $ 1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams . </s><s> `` there could be provisions made for some players , '' said jeffrey kessler , the chief outside counsel for the union . </s><s> `` we do n't want to do anything that would encourage chicago from getting michael jordan back . </s><s> and i think the league feels the same way . '' </s><s> the proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiations , but it would not be nearly as liberal . </s><s> _ a salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary . </s><s> whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year . </s><s> if the figure was $ 29 million over the salary cap , then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $ 1 million less than the previous season . </s><s> but the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $ 2 million before the credit goes into effect . </s><s> _ also , if the 63-percent threshold is met , a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts . </s><s> players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues . </s><s> the union said this clearly addresses the league 's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues . </s><s> since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries , the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal . </s><s> _ teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies , meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal . </s><s> currently , the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his bird rights after two seasons _ a clause kevin garnett parlayed into an astronomical $ 126 million deal last year with minnesota . </s><s> _ finally , the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance . </s><s> details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs , a provision the owners included in their last proposal . </s><s> in return for the concessions , the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $ 272,500 _ and creation of an average salary exception . </s><s> this would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary _ currently $ 2.6 million . </s><s> `` we 're buoyed by the fact for the first time they 've decided to submit a counterproposal , '' the union 's executive director , billy hunter , said . </s><s> `` i do n't know if i 'm more optimistic , but i can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we made a valiant effort . '' </s><s> asked if the players would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games , hunter added : `` it 's not about us blinking . </s><s> we want to reach an agreement . </s><s> we 're tired of the rhetoric , we 're tired of the game-playing . </s><s> our position all along has been we do n't want to accept a bad deal . '' </s><s> granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason games . </s><s> he estimated the losses into the `` hundreds of millions of dollars . '' </s><s> `` i think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically , '' he added . </s><s> `` but there 's some possibility . '' </s><s> added stern , `` we owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted . </s><s> it does n't look promising , but we 're going to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response . '' </s><s> though the decision to cancel games was not surprising , it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates . </s><s> both sides reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and preserving the nba 's perfect record . </s><s> tuesday , they could not come to such an accord . </s><s> `` i 'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel , '' granik said . </s><s> `` but unless this or something else works , or there 's some dramatic breakthrough , i think that is certainly not all of the season that 's in jeopardy .

desperate  policy kill people	a congressman who visited remote parts of north korea last week said saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating , and that millions of north koreans might have starved to death in the last few years . </s><s> the congressman , tony hall , d-ohio , who has had a longtime interest in world hunger , passed through tokyo on his return to the united states and showed photographs he had taken of north korean children with patchy hair , protruding bones , open sores and other signs of severe malnutrition . </s><s> hall also brought back a bag of what officials called `` substitute food '' being distributed by a government food station : dried leaves and straw , so coarse that even cattle would normally turn away . </s><s> `` they grind it into powder and make it into noodles , '' hall said . </s><s> the noodles have no nutrition and are indigestible , leaving people holding their aching stomachs , he said . </s><s> north korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulties , but there have been sharply diverging assessments of how serious these are . </s><s> some visitors with the united nations and other organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit better now than a year or two ago . </s><s> hall said that the divergence might have arisen because in the north korean capital , pyongyang , life did seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to north korea . </s><s> but in rural areas where foreigners are not often allowed to visit , he added , the overall situation is worse than ever . </s><s> based on visits to four hospitals , hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply . </s><s> in one hospital , assistants were holding down a patient while surgeons conducted a stomach operation without electric lights or anesthesia . </s><s> ordinary north koreans are suffering , in part , because their government 's hard-line policies have alienated would-be donors and aid agencies . </s><s> the united nations has repeatedly appealed for relief aid for north korea , but the latest appeal has raised less than one-third of the target . </s><s> in september , doctors without borders announced that it was pulling its staff of 13 from north korea because it feared that its aid was going to the politically connected rather than to the most needy . </s><s> north korea does not release mortality figures or health statistics , but hall said that the united nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent of north korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent of all children are physically stunted . </s><s> hall said he thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that the total was probably closer to 3 million . </s><s> in an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation , the u.s. bureau of the census recently published estimates suggesting that north korea 's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and has since fallen to 21.23 million this year . </s><s> that would be a decline of 320,000 over three years , a period when north korea 's population would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people , based on the population growth rate of the early 1990s . </s><s> nicholas eberstadt ,

gingrich 's counter-campaign has given some members pause about ousting him . </s><s> at the same time , a small band of republicans vowed on thursday that they would not vote to re-elect gingrich

have made the decision that i can not vote for newt gingrich for speaker in january , and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way , seven people who just will not , and it takes six to deadlock the vote . '' </s><s> fury at the speaker has boiled over since tuesday 's elections , when republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the house . </s><s> they blamed gingrich , the party 's chief strategist . </s><s> but many were already angry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget process that gave president clinton a political edge and contradicted republican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amounts of spending for local projects . </s><s> house republicans are to meet nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders . </s><s> whoever wins the republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full house in january . </s><s> even if gingrich wins the secret ballot , he could be denied re-election as speaker in january if salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him . </s><s> because the republicans now control the house by only 12 seats , it would take just six votes against gingrich to deny him a majority . </s><s> with such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming , livingston told gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party , republican officials said . </s><s> the officials said that livingston spoke to gingrich shortly after the election returns but also before the election , reflecting livingston 's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process . </s><s> several republicans said that both livingston , the chairman of the appropriations committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker , and gingrich were working the phones on thursday in a struggle for votes . </s><s> livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to gingrich , but several members and aides said on thursday that he would announce his intentions , possibly as soon as friday , only after he had determined if he could win . </s><s> rep. peter king , r-n.y. , was one of several members who spoke with livingston on thursday . </s><s> `` he told me he 's making a number of phone calls , that he 's gotten a very positive response about running for speaker , and he 'll decide within the next 48 hours , '' king said . </s><s> `` he wo n't do it till he has his ducks in a row , and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker , '' said an aide to a republican who , like many others , is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party . </s><s> many republicans immediately blamed gingrich for the party 's losses on tuesday . </s><s> talk quickly emerged the next day of a slate of candidates to oppose gingrich and his lieutenants . </s><s> the list of possible candidates for leadership positions included rep.e steve largent of oklahoma , who talked with livingston on thursday about challenging gingrich , republican officials said , speaking on the condition that their names not be reported . </s><s> those officials said that largent told livingston that he wanted to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge rep. dick armey , the majority leader . </s><s> but , these officials said that if livingston did not challenge gingrich , largent would run for speaker instead . </s><s> other names were floated wednesday for leadership posts . </s><s> they included reps. david mcintosh of indiana for speaker and jennifer dunn of washington as conference chairman . </s><s> added to the mix on thursday was the name of rep. christopher cox , a california conservative . </s><s> as a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among house members on thursday , rep. henry hyde , the chairman of the judiciary committee and one of the house 's most venerable members , rebuffed a chance to endorse gingrich as speaker . </s><s> hyde said that gingrich bore responsibility for the party 's losses tuesday . </s><s> `` leadership takes credit when things go right , '' he said . </s><s> `` they ought to take the blame when things go wrong . '' </s><s> asked if gingrich should remain speaker , hyde said : `` i rather think he will , but that remains to be seen . '' </s><s> the energy that many vented publicly on wednesday as anger toward gingrich seemed devoted on thursday to intense internal political calculations about whether livingston could succeed in toppling gingrich and whether he should succeed . </s><s> while many support him as a veteran who understands the house and has shown shrewd political skills in managing the massive federal budget , others are reviving images of the louisianan as a hot-head who gave the party a bad name during the government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward arm-flailing in heated moments . </s><s> one conservative leader said that he and his allies had reservations about livingston because he was `` obsessed '' about trying to keep social issues out of the budget process . </s><s> the budget , he said , `` has been a vehicle for conservatives over the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and other things you ca n't get through the senate or past a presidential veto . </s><s> if livingston is the challenger , i doubt that will cause a rallying of the real conservatives in congress .

'' </s><s> salmon said his refusal to support gingrich no matter what was based on gingrich 's track record of `` one failed strategy after another , '' including the impeachment process and the pork-laden budget . </s><s> with the challenge under way , gingrich has been trying to show members that he is responsive to their concerns . </s><s> after an election night in which he portrayed the republicans as victorious even as they lost seats , the next day he took `` responsibility '' for the losses . </s><s> in another move , gingrich has indicated that he is willing to cede control over the party 's congressional campaign committee , allowing the whole house to select its members . </s><s> gingrich is also making strong personal appeals to republicans . </s><s> said one top house aide : `` he 'll get support . </s><s> how much ? </s><s> only his own vote-counters know .

'' </s><s> undersecretary of state sousa lara was so upset by one of saramago 's novels in 1992 that he withdrew his name from portugal 's nominees for the european literature prize . </s><s> at the time , lara said saramago 's 1991 novel `` o evangelho segundo jesus cristo '' ( the gospel according to jesus christ ) offended portugal 's roman catholic religious convictions and divided the country . </s><s> the book describes a christ who , subject to human desires , lives with mary magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion . </s><s> `` i have not come to bring peace but the sword , '' said saramago , an atheist , at the time . </s><s> he retreated in disgust with his spanish wife , pilar del rio , to his home in lanzarote in spain 's canary islands . </s><s> he has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary prizes , and his bluntness can sometimes offend . </s><s> `` i am skeptical , reserved , i do n't gush , i do n't go around smiling , hugging people and trying to make friends , '' he once said . </s><s> a gaunt man with wisps of white hair , saramago was born in azinhaga , a small town near lisbon . </s><s> from a poor family , he never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker . </s><s> his first novel , published in 1947 _ `` terra do pecado , '' or `` country of sin '' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis . </s><s> it sold badly but won enough recognition to propel him from the welder 's shop to a literary magazine . </s><s> but for the next 18 years , saramago , a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative dictatorship of antonio salazar , published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist . </s><s> he returned to fiction only after salazar 's regime was toppled by a military uprising in 1974 . </s><s> since the 1980s , he has been one of portugal 's best-selling contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages . </s><s> he first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical fantasy `` memorial do convento , '' published in english in 1988 as `` baltasar and blimunda .

'' </s><s> saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentaries , though his views are always inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man . </s><s> `` blindness , '' his most recent book to be translated into english , is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society . </s><s> `` this blindness is n't a real blindness , it 's a blindness of rationality , '' he said . </s><s> `` we 're rational beings but we do n't behave rationally . </s><s> if we did , there 'd be no starvation in the world .

olympic bid  investigation begin	ioc  salt lake city  dlrs 400000  scholarship  votebuying  pound	moving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal , ioc leaders questioned salt lake city officials friday in the first ever investigation into alleged vote-buying by an olympic city . </s><s> acting with unusual speed , the international olympic committee set up a special investigative panel that immediately summoned the organizers of the 2002 salt lake games to address the bribery allegations . </s><s> the chief investigator refused to rule out the possibility of taking the games away from salt lake city _ though that scenario is considered highly unlikely . </s><s> frank joklik , president of the salt lake organizing committee , and sloc senior vice president dave johnson appeared before the ioc panel for 90 minutes friday night . </s><s> both sides declined to comment after the talks , saying the inquiry was still in process . </s><s> earlier , joklik met with ioc president juan antonio samaranch and other top officials to provide information and documents on the case . </s><s> the controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of ioc members by the salt lake bid committee which won the right to stage the 2002 games . </s><s> senior ioc executive board member marc hodler said the scholarship fund _ described as `` humanitarian aid '' by salt lake officials _ amounted to a bribe to sway votes in the 1995 election . </s><s> it 's the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigated by the ioc since former u.s. member robert helmick was accused of conflict of interest in 1991 . </s><s> helmick eventually resigned both as an ioc member and as president of the u.s. olympic committee . </s><s> this is the first time the ioc has ever investigated possible bribery by bidding cities , despite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other olympic votes . </s><s> `` the executive board takes this matter very seriously , '' said dick pound , the ioc vice president heading the salt lake inquiry . </s><s> `` despite many requests made in the past or evidence to support rumors that have been floating around , we have never had anything come forward . </s><s> `` specific allegations have now been made . </s><s> the executive board acted very quickly to investigate . '' </s><s> also on the investigative panel are ioc vice president keba mbaye , executive board members jacques rogge and thomas bach , and ioc director general francois carrard . </s><s> pound said the panel would investigate allegations that `` there may or may not have been payments for the benefit of members of the ioc or their families connected with the salt lake city bid . '' </s><s> pound , a canadian lawyer , said there was no deadline for completion of the investigation but said it was possible the inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend . </s><s> pound declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could be taken against salt lake but did not rule out moving the games elsewhere . </s><s> `` we 're not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as to what we may decide until we know what the facts are , '' he said . </s><s> moving the games would be unprecedented and , with just over three years to go , would be a logistical nightmare . </s><s> most of the facilities needed for the games in salt lake already are built . </s><s> john krimsky , deputy secretary general of the u.s. olympic committee , discounted any possibility of the games being moved . </s><s> `` there is no chance at all , absolutely none in my mind , '' he said . </s><s> `` i ca n't be stronger in saying i do n't consider it a possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn from salt lake city. '' </s><s> salt lake organizers have denied that the bid committee 's dlrs 500,000 project was an effort to buy key ioc members ' support in the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 winter games . </s><s> salt lake lost the '98 race to nagano , japan , in 1991 , when the program was begun . </s><s> it won a landslide vote over sion , switzerland , for the 2002 games in the 1995 balloting . </s><s> from 1991 to 1995 , the bid committee _ under the direction of former president thomas welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of ioc members , mostly from africa . </s><s> olympic rules prohibit bidding cities from giving ioc members or their relatives any presents or benefits exceeding a value of dlrs 150 . </s><s> `` i 've already stated i do not regard what was done as a bribe , '' joklik said friday . </s><s> `` i recognize there have been perceptions contrary to that . </s><s> i regret those perceptions , but i do n't feel they are justified .

competition force unlikely merger economic survival	exxonmobil merger could lead saving benefit consumer	exxonmobil merger would recombine standard oil part  cut job	whether or not the talks between exxon and mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination , america 's economic history is already being rewritten . </s><s> in energy as in businesses like financial services , telecommunications and automobiles , global competition and technology have made unthinkable combinations practical , even necessary . </s><s> oil companies like exxon corp. and mobil corp. have an additional pressure , one unthinkable less than two decades ago . </s><s> crude oil prices have fallen sharply , plunging 40 percent just this year to levels , adjusted for inflation , not seen since before the first oil embargo 25 years ago . </s><s> as such , the oil companies , having spent years cutting their costs , are desperate for further savings in order to continue operating profitably with such low prices . </s><s> exxon and mobil are the two largest , strongest competitors to emerge from the nation 's most famous antitrust case , the 1911 breakup of john d. rockefeller 's standard oil trust . </s><s> now they face a royal dutch/shell group that is larger than either of them . </s><s> they will also confront a british petroleum plc made far more potent in the united states by its agreement this summer to buy amoco corp. for $ 48.2 billion . </s><s> industry executives say further deals on this scale are inevitable . </s><s> executives at both companies did not return calls thursday for comment on the talks , and it was unclear thursday night what the outcome might be . </s><s> but if exxon and mobil agree to become one , antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart . </s><s> even so , most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them . </s><s> `` the ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer , '' said daniel yergin , the chairman of cambridge energy research associates . </s><s> if exxon and mobil ultimately do combine , the costs could prove heaviest for energy industry employees . </s><s> analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at exxon , based in irving , texas , and the more than 40,000 at mobil , in fairfax , va. , thousands would be likely to lose their jobs . </s><s> exxon , with lee r. raymond , and mobil , with lucio a. noto , both have chief executives who have been preoccupied with the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary . </s><s> oil companies were everybody 's favorite targets during the trust-busting era early this century and again during the arab oil embargoes of the 1970s . </s><s> now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in much of the world , especially in economically troubled asia , weighing further on already depressed prices . </s><s> `` they 're pitiful , helpless giants , '' said ronald chernow , the author of `` titan , '' a biography of john d. rockefeller , standard oil 's founder . </s><s> as such , these giants are compelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their huge , expensive international projects that are needed to develop oil reserves needed for the next century . </s><s> mobil , with $ 58.4 billion in sales last year , might seem large enough to undertake anything . </s><s> but in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in turkmenistan , a former soviet republic , mobil was unable to match shell 's offer to build a pipeline for $ 1 billion or more . </s><s> oil companies have decided that they can not count on a rebound in oil prices to revive their fortunes any time soon . </s><s> earlier this month , the energy department predicted that the collapse of asian demand would continue to depress oil prices for nearly a decade , and by as much as $ 5.50 a barrel in the year 2000 . </s><s> and thursday , the organization of petroleum exporting countries put off until march any decision on extending their oil production cutbacks to prop up prices . </s><s> moreover , improving technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions to development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is on hand now . </s><s> in response , many energy companies have already begun a new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations . </s><s> to further reduce costs , companies like mobil are forming partnerships that stop short of full mergers . </s><s> two years ago , mobil agreed to combine its european refining and marketing operations with british petroleum 's , resulting in annual savings of about $ 500 million . </s><s> shell and texaco then formed a refining partnership in the united states . </s><s> in the face of these partnerships , said amy jaffe , an energy analysts with the james a. baker iii institute for public policy in houston , `` if you 're an exxon , how do you compete ? '' </s><s> though mobil and exxon might have high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the united states , analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s . </s><s> thousands of convenience stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies , and foreign national oil companies , like venezuela 's , sell their supplies through acquired companies like citgo . </s><s> under noto , mobil has been hunting for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive . </s><s> he took the lead in the deal with british petroleum and has considered buying up smaller companies . </s><s> and he has made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block a deal . </s><s> in the european agreement with british petroleum , mobil 's red flying horses have come down from the fronts of many gas stations , while the green and yellow bp logos have gone up . </s><s> as major oil companies team up , said john hervey , an analyst with donaldson lufkin & amp ; jenrette , `` if the price is right , egos will not get in the way . '' </s><s> in the past , mobil reportedly had further talks with british petroleum about other combinations , as well as talks with amoco about forming an american refining venture . </s><s> the company was also interested in conoco inc. when dupont co. began looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business . </s><s> but no deals were reached . </s><s> more recently , there was speculation on wall street that mobil had been talking with chevron corp. british petroleum purchase of amoco put more pressure on noto to seek a deal , hervey said . </s><s> `` i do n't think this whole thing would have started if british petroleum had not pulled the trigger , '' he said . </s><s> the british petroleum-amoco deal , progressing quickly since the august announcement towards an expected $ 2 billion in annual savings , has put even companies as large as exxon on the spot . </s><s> there , raymond has so far concentrated more on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies . </s><s> though royal dutch/shell 's financial resources are greater than exxon 's , some analysts say exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb a company of mobil 's size . </s><s> only the largest oil companies can afford to take advantage of today 's best opportunities . </s><s> finding new fields in the deep waters off the coast of west africa or in the gulf of mexico can require platforms costing $ 1 billion or more . </s><s> producing oil in the states of the former soviet union has taken more time and money than many investors anticipated . </s><s> in september , noto was among the american executives invited by a saudi leader visiting washington to greatly step up investments in his country , too . </s><s> noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in saudi arabia himself , building up mobil operations including a huge refinery . </s><s> but any new partnerships with the saudis might require both mobil 's connections and exxon 's capital . </s><s> back when standard oil organized its operations by state , exxon was standard oil of new jersey , while mobil was standard oil of new york . </s><s> even after the standard oil monopoly was broken up , they remained for several years in the same building in manhattan . </s><s> chernow , the rockefeller biographer , noted that two pieces of the standard oil trust are already likely to be united . </s><s> british petroleum bought standard oil of ohio in the 1970s , and amoco was once standard oil of indiana . </s><s> the break-up of standard oil and the resulting competition has often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action against microsoft . </s><s> chernow sees no reason why allowing an exxon acquisition of mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for microsoft . </s><s> `` exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors , the way microsoft is , '' he said . </s><s> in the energy business today , he added , `` there are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle . ''	exxon and mobil may join because of plunging crude oil prices .	global competition forcing unlikely mergers for economic survival	exxon-mobil merger could lead to further savings and benefit consumers	exxon-mobil merger would recombine standard oil parts , cut jobs .

north korea over a suspected nuclear site , and he warned the north 's communist leaders not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula . </s><s> president kim dae-jung , appearing with clinton at a news conference , pledged to `` spare no effort in supporting the u.s. endeavor '' to resolve the nuclear question . </s><s> he called for full access for u.s. inspectors at a north korean underground facility and said the north must not develop missiles . </s><s> on the first of two days in south korea , clinton also held a roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting the nation 's economy back on track . </s><s> economics and security are clinton 's twin themes on a five-day asia trip that began in japan . </s><s> clinton

if it refuses a u.s. inspection of the site . </s><s> `` it raises a strong suspicion , '' clinton said at a joint news conference with kim at the blue house , the presidential mansion overlooking the capital . </s><s> `` we need access to it . '' </s><s> the foundation of u.s. efforts to ease north korea 's decades-long hostility toward the south is a 1994 `` agreed framework '' in which the north halted its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a western commitment to build modern nuclear energy sources there . </s><s> that deal would be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project . </s><s> kim , who has moved south korea to a `` sunshine '' policy of engaging north korea on cultural and economic fronts , was firm in saying his government supports clinton on the nuclear issue . </s><s> in meetings this week in pyongyang , the north korean capital , u.s. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious site , which american intelligence officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the north 's nuclear weapons program . </s><s> `` we must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature and the purposes of the construction site , '' kim said . </s><s> `` if it is , in fact , proven that it is nuclear related , we should demand immediate close down .

'' </s><s> kim said his government would support u.s. efforts to resolve the nuclear question . </s><s> the north koreans have denied the underground construction site has any nuclear purpose , and have proposed a dlrs 300 million payment for allowing inspections . </s><s> clinton rejected the idea of compensation . </s><s> directing his remarks at north korea , clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal that is bringing south koreans to the north on cruise ships _ an arrangement touted by kim as a sign the north may be opening up to its 1950s korean war enemy . </s><s> `` nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground , given our defense partnership here , that would give the north koreans as much advantage , as much power , as much wealth , as much happiness , as more of those ships going up there full of people from here , '' clinton said . </s><s> in his meeting with korean community and business leaders at seoul 's national folklore museum , clinton praised south korea 's progress in recovering from its financial crisis . </s><s> on a darker note , he mentioned recent tensions over asian steel exports to the united states , which have skyrocketed this year at great cost to the domestic u.s. steelmakers . </s><s> japanese steel is the biggest problem , but south korean steel exports also are on the rise . </s><s> clinton said the u.s. economy could tolerate increased imports _ if they are not concentrated in just a few industries , and if the result is that the asian economies begin to recover . </s><s> `` we have to be sensitive if the price of doing that is to basically erase '' an entire sector of the u.s. economy , clinton said .	u.s. warns n. korea not to waste chance for peace over alleged nuclear site	n korea 's suspected nuclear ambitions cast shadow on clinton asian trip	south korea supports u.s. in confronting north korea over nuclear site	clinton in asia : economics and security , especially north korean affronts .

'' </s><s> and asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a senate race is , in the words of stuart stevens , a republican consultant , `` a double bank-shot . '' </s><s> such strategies , he said , tend to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated voters . </s><s> against that complicated backdrop , the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race , state to state and week to week , depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate . </s><s> if democrats try to turn the image of clinton in the dock to their advantage , it would be in states with a democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters , who overwhelmingly support the president . </s><s> in contests like those , it might well prove to be in the interest of a democratic candidate to , as one consultant put it , sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president 's behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment . </s><s> strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective . </s><s> `` this is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites and the public , '' said fred yang , a democratic consultant with clients in wisconsin and the carolinas . </s><s> that kind of democratic strategy might emerge in california , new york , illinois , wisconsin , washington and perhaps arkansas . </s><s> by contrast , democrats in south carolina , georgia and nevada would be less likely to oppose clinton 's impeachment . </s><s> on the other side , republican consultants are telling their candidates to stress clinton 's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment . </s><s> the last thing the party wants is to turn the senate elections into a referendum on whether clinton should be forced from office . </s><s> `` the white house might think from the overall public numbers that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election , '' said ed goeas , a republican pollster who is working in senate races this year . </s><s> `` republicans certainly are n't going to let that happen . '' </s><s> d'amato responded to questions about clinton with the language that republican consultants have been suggesting to their candidates . </s><s> `` when and if that matter comes to the senate , i will decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time , '' d'amato said . </s><s> `` it would be very premature for me to suggest any course of action without it being referred . </s><s> because , indeed , we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind . '' </s><s> but schumer , a member of the house judiciary committee , which is conducting the impeachment investigation , virtually embraced the issue . </s><s> in a live telecast of the hearings , he said the president deserved a lesser punishment , such as censure or reprimand . </s><s> and schumer plans to campaign in new york on monday with clinton at his side . </s><s> schumer 's media adviser , hank morris , seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow as an issue . </s><s> `` senator d'amato claims he does not want to share his opinion with the people of new york , '' morris said . </s><s> `` and if he does n't have an opinion , he 's the only new yorker who does n't have an opinion .

, to atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group , operation rescue , onto america 's front pages , james charles kopp was in the van riding alongside him , according to former leaders of operation rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity . </s><s> and , those people say , when terry was arrested on the first day of operation rescue 's `` siege of atlanta , '' kopp followed him into jail . </s><s> along with more than one hundred other operation rescue members , according to some people who were there , kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered to terry 's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts . </s><s> after his release , kopp returned to operation rescue 's binghamton headquarters , and was there working alongside terry as the group 's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 and 1989 , according to the former leaders of operation rescue . </s><s> now , kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities for questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician who performed abortions in the buffalo region . </s><s> the authorities also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions in canada and upstate new york . </s><s> some abortion-rights groups are seizing on kopp 's role in operation rescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s . </s><s> for years , the federal bureau of investigation and the justice department have looked in vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might be behind a series of clinic bombings and shootings of doctors and other clinic staff members that began in the early 1990s . </s><s> a federal grand jury in alexandria , va. , that looked into conspiracy allegations was ultimately disbanded without finding a national underground . </s><s> but some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that kopp may help provide such a link . </s><s> in fact , the announcement that law enforcement officials are looking for him has been made as attorney general janet reno has prepared to revive an interagency task force to look once again for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes . </s><s> federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say kopp is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on oct. 23 that killed dr. barnett a. slepian near buffalo . </s><s> but they say kopp 's car was seen near slepian 's home in amherst , n.y. in the weeks before the doctor was shot . </s><s> one day after issuing a warrant for kopp 's arrest as a material witness , law enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies spanning the united states and canadian border still had not located kopp thursday . </s><s> but law enforcement officials said they were pursuing many tips , including about 400 that have poured into the fbi 's information line : ( 800 ) 281-1184 . </s><s> the police have gone through photographs of abortion protesters and clinic workers in buffalo and around the country , and they are also reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in search of kopp 's face . </s><s> at this point , officials consider the shooting of slepian to be connected to three attacks in canada and one in rochester on doctors who provide abortions . </s><s> the five attacks , all since 1994 , occurred in the weeks leading up to nov. 11 , veterans day _ called remembrance day in canada _ a holiday that has become important to anti-abortion activists . </s><s> but the attacks were spread over four years and 3,000 miles , from vancouver , british columbia , to buffalo . </s><s> as is the case with many early veterans of operation rescue , kopp was transformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in atlanta in 1988 , according to many people who were in jail with him who insisted on anonymity .	federal authorities looking into conspiracy allegations in clinic

deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician in upstate new york , attorney general janet reno announced last week that she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot . </s><s> the unit , the national clinic violence task force , will include a dozen justice department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies . </s><s> but the main work of looking into the shooting of dr. barnett slepian in his suburban buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized violence will be done by the fbi , which has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism . </s><s> for many in the fbi , that 's a problem . </s><s> in contrast to the old image of gung-ho fbi agents turning their surveillance machinery on political groups , a number of senior fbi agents privately expressed misgivings about the attorney general 's latest task force , the second she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence . </s><s> fbi officials fear that expanding the investigation could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes and unpopular ideas . </s><s> today 's agents are eager to disassociate themselves from the old j. edgar hoover days of trampling the civil rights of political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations . </s><s> they do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates , who have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against clinics and doctors . </s><s> many of those calling for government help were once themselves subjects of fbi interest as anti-war and civil rights activists . </s><s> senior agency officials , including director louis freeh , were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay as the fbi was shaken by revelations about cointelpro , the counterintelligence program that allowed agents to spy on , burgle , wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups like students for a democratic society and the student nonviolence coordinating committee . </s><s> some officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions . </s><s> they came up empty handed when reno ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a florida doctor and his bodyguard . </s><s> the justice department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation ; agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams . </s><s> but investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff members . </s><s> violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem . </s><s> the fbi has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield of politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti-government militias , environmental and christian extremists , white separatists , animal rights activists and islamic fundamentalists . </s><s> `` the fbi is very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political association , '' said david cole , a law professor at georgetown university . </s><s> `` when you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups , that all-important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost , the focus gets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful political activity . '' </s><s> in response to terrorist attacks like the bombings of the world trade center in 1993 , the oklahoma city federal building in 1995 and the olympic park in atlanta in 1996 , the agency has increased efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program . </s><s> in such cases , the justice department , the fbi and other law enforcement agencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that require investigators to find a `` reasonable indication '' that a group is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into an organization . </s><s> before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches , they must have specific evidence . </s><s> yet fbi agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups . </s><s> their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger . </s><s> much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group , drifting along society 's frayed margins , `` off the grid , '' as some agents describe it , without the usual ties to family , friends or work . </s><s> the profile fits eric robert rudolph , the fugitive wanted for bombings at the atlanta olympics , a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics . </s><s> he has kept his beliefs mostly to himself , although acquaintances hint that he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups . </s><s> in contrast , james charles kopp , who is being sought as a material witness in the killing of slepian , left a trail of clues about his motives . </s><s> he was an early follower of randall terry , a leader of operation rescue . </s><s> later , kopp was associated with the lambs of christ , an another militant anti-abortion group . </s><s> one law-enforcement official said that the government should do what it does best . </s><s> `` we should investigate violations , '' he said . </s><s> `` we should n't investigate groups .

most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage , from countries including iraq , iran , somalia , ethiopia and current and former yugoslavia . </s><s> the first call alerting

but it is not easy to keep the mind uncluttered . </s><s> williams does not know if he will sign with the yankees and return to center field next season , because he wants to test free agency . </s><s> there is a good chance the yankees will not offer him the most lavish contract , so williams might be forced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation in the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a familiar situation in the bronx . </s><s> scott boras , williams ' agent , compared his client with players in the $ 10 million-a-year bracket last season , so that price tag has surely escalated after williams won the american league batting title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homers and knocking in 97 runs . </s><s> williams was asked if he agreed with the theory that other teams will outbid the yankees . </s><s> `` i do not know , '' said williams , who has been aloof during this post-season , but has declined to discuss why . </s><s> `` and i 'm thinking about this a little more than i would like to . </s><s> i would like to keep my focus on the series .

'' </s><s> although williams has been adamant about not discussing the future , he relented slightly friday . </s><s> when a reporter asked him what the reasons would be for staying with the yankees , williams ' answer included an escape clause . </s><s> `` just the fact that i 've been here my whole career , '' williams said . </s><s> `` that has a lot to do with it . </s><s> the relationships that i 've come to know during the years , i think it would be very hard , but not impossible , to start from scratch somewhere else .

'' </s><s> while cashman would not discuss financial matters , another yankee official said the team will not offer williams as much as $ 12 million a year _ unless steinbrenner gets generous after a possible championship . </s><s> it is more likely that the yanks would offer williams in the $ 10 million-a-year range . </s><s> `` i 'd hate to have to speculate on something at this point , '' cashman said . </s><s> `` we 'll give it our best effort to sign him at a level that we 're comfortable with . </s><s> hopefully , that will be enough . </s><s> then we 'll have a marriage . </s><s> if not , we 'll have a divorce . '' </s><s> while williams has earned the right to become a free agent and pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants , he has interesting choices to make . </s><s> when a reporter asked williams how he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less from the yankees to remain in a city where he is popular , where he likes his teammates and manager , and where the team has been in the post-season for four straight years , he did not hesitate to answer . </s><s> `` my response to that would be it 's not the time right now to start thinking about that , '' williams said . </s><s> `` if i start thinking about that , it 'll distract me to what i need to do in the world series . '' </s><s> williams then talked about how the yankees are at the end of a remarkable season and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that . </s><s> but , with williams ' status uncertain , he was asked if the next four to seven games would be bittersweet , since he could be ending a 13-year association with the yankees . </s><s> `` i do n't want to talk about that , '' williams said . </s><s> `` i 'm going to have a lot of fun out there . </s><s> i 'm going to go all out .

budget  politician agree harder deficit one	federal budget negotiation tougher good time	for the first time in decades , congress and the white house negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus . </s><s> the result was chaos . </s><s> the lawmakers were never able to agree on a budget resolution _ the framework into which all the tax and spending bills are supposed to fit . </s><s> this had not happened since congressional budget procedures were established in 1974 . </s><s> then , without the discipline of such an overall plan , the senate and the house could not pass eight of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running . </s><s> so the lawmakers had to stay in session more than a week longer than they had hoped . </s><s> finally , they lumped all eight bills together this week and announced an agreement . </s><s> but the only way they could get this far was to resort to gimmicks . </s><s> one was to designate $ 20 billion as `` emergency '' expenditures so that programs did not have to be cut elsewhere to offset the new spending . </s><s> this will use up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year . </s><s> another gimmick extended the tax break for individual retirement accounts to couples with incomes from $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 . </s><s> this will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years _ the period covered by budget accounting _ but it will make the picture considerably worse in later years . </s><s> as hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the bad old days of budget deficits , say the politicians involved , it was exponentially more difficult this year . </s><s> at least in years past , there was a common goal . </s><s> as much as they disagreed on policy and principle , they were all aiming at a reduction in the deficit . </s><s> this year , some members of congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut . </s><s> others wanted to pay off the national debt . </s><s> others wanted to spend part of it on medical research , schools and weapons for the pentagon . </s><s> others wanted to spend large sums on highways . </s><s> still others wanted to continue cutting government spending . </s><s> and that was just among the republicans . </s><s> the democrats had their own ideas about the budget , and president clinton laid down his marker about saving the surplus until a way was found to shore up the social security system . </s><s> `` in budget terms , '' said robert reischauer , a former director of the congressional budget office , `` this is like the end of the cold war . '' </s><s> there are other differences as well in the way things were negotiated with the budget in a surplus . </s><s> in 1990 , 1993 and 1995 , when politicians staked their careers on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit , the fundamental question was how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and less spending . </s><s> republicans , for the most part , opposed tax increases and favored cutting spending on social programs . </s><s> democrats wanted to raise taxes , especially on the rich , and protect social spending . </s><s> in the end , balances were carefully drawn . </s><s> but plenty of politicians _ president george bush , to name one _ lost their jobs in the process . </s><s> this year , with democrats and republicans alike claiming victory , the burning issue was how to parcel out the candy . </s><s> democrats got more money for education and farm assistance . </s><s> republicans got more money for the military and an extension of popular tax breaks for businesses . </s><s> some of the $ 20 billion that will eat into the surplus really will go for emergencies , like relief for victims of hurricane georges . </s><s> but much of the money , like the $ 90 million that will pay for six new helicopters for the national police in colombia to use in drug interdiction , was designated emergency spending simply because there was no other way to get it into the budget . </s><s> for the politicians , the new way is more fun . </s><s> it is hard to imagine that anyone will be voted out of office because of this year 's budget . </s><s> but that did not make it easier to reach an agreement . </s><s> the other big difference is that the principal fights this year were not over money at all . </s><s> they involved delicate policy issues like needle exchanges , contraception , global warming , immigration and the census . </s><s> in congress , there is no consensus on these matters . </s><s> so the only way policy could be set was to wrap them into the giant spending bill . </s><s> it may be more pleasant to debate policy than money . </s><s> but it is probably harder to find a way to split the difference . </s><s> as long as the surplus lasts , the lack of discipline that characterized the budget-writing this year is likely to continue . </s><s> this is distressing to those devoted to controlling government spending . </s><s> `` the temptation , '' said l. ari fleischer , spokesman for the house ways and means committee , `` is to grab the loot and spend it . ''	budget surplus prevents agreement on a final budget resolution	negotiations on using budget surplus , 1st in decades , produces chaos .	surplus budget done ; politicians agree harder to do than deficit one .	federal budget negotiations tougher in good times

trial	material unpublished book evidence side microsoft case	cusumano  yoffie microsoft  browser  single integrated product  netscape	microsoft corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week . </s><s> but judging from an advance copy of the manuscript , the justice department and 20 states that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments in the book as well . </s><s> to cite one example , microsoft contends that its industry-standard windows operating system and its internet explorer browser are a single integrated product . </s><s> in its suit , the government asserts that they are two separate products that microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over its rival , netscape communications corp. , in the market for software used to browse the internet 's world wide web . </s><s> in `` competing on internet time : lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft , '' the authors , michael a. cusumano of the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management and david b. yoffie of the harvard business school , quote a microsoft executive as saying that only with the third version of microsoft 's browser was it integrated with windows . </s><s> microsoft hurried its first browser offerings into the market , the book says , in its race to catch up with netscape , then took a more ambitious approach with internet explorer 3.0 , which was introduced in august 1996 . </s><s> in that version it changed its software design to use programming modules , or components , that could be put together and rearragned like building blocks . </s><s> in the book , ben slivka , a microsoft general manager , is quoted as saying , `` ie 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser , '' he added , `` we really made internet explorer part of the windows platform . '' </s><s> the timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government cites as evidence requests before august 1996 by personal computer makers that wanted to load netscape 's browser on their machines instead of microsoft 's browser . </s><s> microsoft denied the requests , insisting its browers and windows were a single , integrated product . </s><s> microsoft 's legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month , by issuing a subpoena to a netscape executive who was given a confidential copy by the authors to review . </s><s> microsoft has also sought the transcripts of 44 current and former netscape employees interviewed by the authors . </s><s> a federal judge in boston last week denied microsoft access to that research materials , but the company may appeal the ruling . </s><s> the new book , published by the free press imprint of simon & amp ; schuster , is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the start of the microsoft trial on oct. 19 . </s><s> but already , a few quotes from netscape executives have leaked out . </s><s> the authors decided to send the complete manuscript to the new york times and three other news organizations monday , so that the material could be read in context . </s><s> microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that netscape 's troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any alleged predatory practices by microsoft . </s><s> the book does detail where netscape stumbled , shifting its strategy too often and running into obstacles in its software development efforts . </s><s> in private antitrust suits , the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is an established defense . </s><s> but legal experts say that defense may well be far less effective in a federal case in which the government is seeking court-mandated changes in microsoft 's business practices rather than the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private cases . </s><s> `` it seems to me that this debate over netscape 's mistakes is a total sideshow , '' said robert litan , a former senior official in the justice department 's antitrust division , who is now at the brookings institution . </s><s> `` but microsoft has a big legal team , and it seems they are working on every defense they can find . '' </s><s> the book quotes a former netscape executive , ram shriram , as saying the company bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from america online inc . </s><s> but that was a second-chance to do a deal with america online , the leading online service . </s><s> the government 's case focuses on an earlier deal in march 1996 , when america online chose internet explorer as its preferred browser ; in that bargain microsoft agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing . </s><s> for a book entitled `` competing on internet time , '' it is intriguing that one of its central themes is that netcape got too wedded to the notion that the internet revolution would change everything quickly . </s><s> microsoft , by contrast , stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled the company , the authors write , to `` mesh its short-run tactical plans with a broader strategic view of how to win the war .

antitrust suit paint dark image microsoft chairman bill gate	gate image  vicious schemer  bully  anxious crush competitor	justice paint dark portrait gate microsoft antitrust suit	will it matter to consumers that bill gates is n't a nice guy ? </s><s> until last week , most americans thought of gates , the chairman of the microsoft corp. , as a genius and innovator . </s><s> a nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer . </s><s> monday , however , in a washington courtroom , the justice department began painting a different , darker portrait of gates . </s><s> in an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states , the man whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a nixonian schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition . </s><s> product innovation , the suit argues , is not a sufficient weapon for gates . </s><s> flashing back and forth between snippets of gates ' videotaped deposition and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony , the government sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of payments by the microsoft chairman . </s><s> it also sought to cast gates as an obsessed man who feared the tiny netscape communications corp. and its potential threat to his domination of the market for internet browsers , the software used to navigate the world wide web . </s><s> gates was portrayed by justice department litigator david boies as a schoolyard bully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness that is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator and high-technology guru . </s><s> according to a document presented by boies , for example , gates asked america online executives in 1996 : `` how much do we need to pay you '' to damage netscape ? </s><s> `` this is your lucky day . '' </s><s> the implication , boies said , was that the amount was irrelevant , and that microsoft , with its deep pockets and market dominance , makes as many `` offers you ca n't refuse '' as needed to achieve its goals . </s><s> microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled gates might be detracting from the company 's world-famous brand name , but they insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive business tactics and the company 's software . </s><s> `` despite what you 're reading in the press , people judge us by our products , '' said mich matthews , head of microsoft 's corporate public-relations office . </s><s> `` our experience is that people vote with their pocketbooks . '' </s><s> so far , consumers are casting positive votes . </s><s> last week microsoft reported quarterly profits of $ 1.52 billion , a stunning 58 percent increase over the level a year earlier . </s><s> despite the record profits , some marketing experts say that if the public comes to view gates as a rockefeller-style robber baron , his company and its brand name may suffer . </s><s> `` when you have a company with such a visible chief executive , the ceo is really the driver of the brand , '' said david aaker , a brand marketing expert at the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley . </s><s> `` there is no question this is going to affect microsoft 's brand recognition . '' </s><s> already there are early warning signals , as political cartoons in newspapers across the country bashed gates last week . </s><s> one showed him holding a globe and saying , `` if you do n't play my way , i 'll take my ball and go home '' ; another portrayed the microsoft chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window while a microsoft secretary says to a caller , `` i 'm sorry , but mr. gates is busy teaching a competitor about windows . '' </s><s> but some industry analysts believe the new view of a bill gates who knows how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company . </s><s> the he-said , she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases both in washington and in silicon valley , where microsoft is locked in a legal battle with its archrival , sun microsystems inc. , is viewed by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that goes on in professional sports . </s><s> `` it 's like taking what charles barkley and michael jordan say to each other on the ball court '' and turning it into something more sinister than it really is , said paul andrews , co-author with stephen manes of `` gates '' ( doubleday , 1993 ) . </s><s> indeed , there is evidence that the darker view of gates and his company has so far taken root only in the district of columbia and in silicon valley , where the computer industry has long felt the impact of gates ' tactics , and where bitterness and distrust of microsoft are deep . </s><s> in the rest of the country , gates continues to enjoy great popularity . </s><s> two weeks ago , while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students at indiana university , a questioner who asked about the justice department 's suit was roundly booed . </s><s> bill gates , whipping boy c.1998 n.y. times news service is bill gates a high-tech machiavelli , public enemy no . </s><s> 1 or a threat to the known universe ? </s><s> all three , judging from the numerous political cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country last week . </s><s> from chattanooga to boston , cartoonists took delight in demonizing gates , who is facing an unexpected public relations challenge as microsoft 's antitrust trial unfolds in washington . </s><s> other cartoons ran the gamut from the predictable ( a worker , pointing to an aquarium in which a large fish is gobbling up smaller ones , saying to some visitors , `` welcome to microsoft 's research and development department '' ) to the weird ( a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen staring at the words : `` our beloved leader , mr. gates , is under attack . </s><s> leave your possessions . </s><s> go to the desert . </s><s> await the spaceship '' ) . </s><s> and that was just week one of the trial . </s><s> stay tuned .	prosecution paints dark portrait of bill gates in antitrust trial	federal anti-trust suit paints dark image of microsoft chairman bill gates	gates image : vicious schemer , bully , anxious to crush competitors	justice paints a dark portrait of gates in microsoft antitrust suit

political reform , the administration 's policy of engaging beijing was called into question monday when chinese courts sentenced three of the nation 's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences . </s><s> critics of china on capitol hill and human rights groups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of the administration 's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties with china in hopes of democratic reform . </s><s> the dissidents _ xu wenli , who was sentenced monday to 13 years in prison , wang youcai , who received an 11-year sentence , and qin yongming , who was reported to have received 12 years were charged with subversion . </s><s> the state department said it had received reports from sources it did not identify that a third leading democracy campaigner , qin yongmin , had been sentenced to 13 years in prison after a trial last week in the city of wuhan . </s><s> relatives of qin in china denied the reports , however , and said that his trial continued . </s><s> given clinton 's effusive praise for china 's senior leaders during his trip to beijing last summer , the administration found itself on the defensive monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences , even as it continued to insist that the administration 's policy of engagement was helping push beijing toward democracy . </s><s> james foley , a state department spokesman , said the united states `` deeply deplores '' the jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents . </s><s> `` these three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than efforts to form a new political party , '' he said . </s><s> while condemning the prison sentences , foley and other american officials were careful to note the administration 's assessment that there had been progress in human rights in china , some of it linked to clinton 's meeting in beijing with chinese president jiang zemin . </s><s> `` there had been improvements in the human rights situation in china , modest improvements , '' foley said . </s><s> the severe prison terms _ and other recent instances of harassment of democracy campaigners in china _ are `` steps backward in relationship to what had been an improved human rights performance , '' he said . </s><s> critics of the administration 's china policy noted that the long prison sentences were handed out less than a week after jiang delivered a pointed speech in beijing in which he made clear that china 's economic reforms were not a prelude to western-style democracy . </s><s> `` the western mode of political systems must never be copied , '' he said , adding that those who challenged the communist party 's supremacy would be crushed . </s><s> rep. nancy pelosi , d-calif. , who has long been among china 's harshest critics in congress , said the prison sentences handed out to xu and wang were `` the clearest demonstration '' since the president 's visit to china last summer of beijing 's `` true intentions regarding human rights . '' </s><s> `` they are pathetic , really pathetic , '' she said of the administration . </s><s> `` the administration can say what it wants , but it must know monday that its policy on china is an embarrassment . </s><s> what the chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in the world . '' </s><s> mike jendrzejczyk , washington director for human rights group , said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration to revise its china policy , which he described as `` almost entirely '' driven by the administration 's desire to encourage trade . </s><s> he said that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights situation in china over the last year _ notably , china 's agreement to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the overall picture was bleak . </s><s> `` on balance , '' he said , `` any progress china has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled out by a more repressive attitude . '' </s><s> human rights watch , the largest american-based human rights group , called on the administration to consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to china early next year by commerce secretary william daley and a high-level trade delegation as a protest over the prison sentences . </s><s> `` that would get beijing 's attention , '' jendrzejczck said . </s><s> other china experts and scholars insisted that the administration was right to continue its policy of engagement with china , and that there was reason to believe that political reform would follow economic reform , as clinton has argued . </s><s> peter rodman , a former nixon and reagan administration official now at the nixon center in washington , said that `` the united states can not control the evolution of a society as complex as china 's . '' </s><s> he said the harsh prison sentences given out monday to the dissidents were to be expected , especially since xu and wang had been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge the communists . </s><s> `` the pattern of this regime is that every once in a while , they ease up a bit and somebody goes too far and there 's a crisis , '' he said . </s><s> `` i do n't think you can blame the united states for this crackdown , nor can you give us credit for any political reforms . </s><s> on human rights , i just do n't think there 's much more we can do .
