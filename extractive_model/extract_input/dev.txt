'' </s><s> publicly , gingrich has expressed confidence about keeping his job as speaker . </s><s> but he has been grim-faced over the last 24 hours and closeted himself wednesday with his top strategists making calls to shore up his support among members . </s><s> `` he looks like the victim of an accident , '' said rep. peter king , r-n.y. , who supports gingrich . </s><s> `` he 's very somber in tone . '' </s><s> the question , as it always is with gingrich , is how many members are prepared to rebel against his leadership . </s><s> in the past , no more than a couple of dozen members have openly expressed their dissatisfaction with him , and a coup attempt last year fizzled for lack of support . </s><s> `` i 'm hoping more people will understand the need for a serious reassessment this year , '' said rep. charles t. canady , r-fla. , who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker after the 1996 elections , when the republicans also lost seats . </s><s> `` the reality is this : our majority keeps shrinking , '' canady said . </s><s> `` if it shrinks any more , it will be gone . '' </s><s> but gingrich has built support among moderates , and some perceived the election as a repudiation of the conservatives . </s><s> rep. sherwood l. boehlert , r-utah , said the results showed that this was the right direction for the party . </s><s> `` to maintain our majority , we 've got to moderate some of our views , '' boehlert said . </s><s> thomas mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution , said that moderates supported gingrich in part because no appealing alternative had emerged . </s><s> `` they know he sees the broader world and is prepared to moderate if it makes sense , '' mann said . </s><s> `` newt 's gone out of his way to support the moderates . </s><s> he 's nurtured a relationship with them . '' </s><s> but mann and others said that anger has been building at gingrich for several reasons , including his signing on to a budget deal last month that seemed to capitulate to president clinton , not offering a clear legislative agenda for republicans and not communicating a clear political message . </s><s> `` we are most defined by who we hate '' said rep. mark souder , r-ind . </s><s> `` but voters are more sophisticated than that , and republicans better have something to say about where we 're going . '' </s><s> the anger grew in the last few days when the speaker approved a $ 10-million anti-clinton advertising campaign that allowed democrats to turn the election into a referendum on gingrich , who has never been nearly as popular with the public as clinton has been . </s><s> as if only slowly absorbing the implications of the loss , the speaker seemed unable at a news conference here wednesday morning to pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seats in the house . </s><s> as late as tuesday afternoon , he was predicting a net pickup of between 10 and 30 . </s><s> `` until we look at it better , i frankly do n't understand all the things that happened yesterday , '' he said , `` and i 'm not sure anybody else in the country does either . '' </s><s> but he said republicans should have `` maniacally focused '' on a basic message of cutting taxes , saving social security and preventing drug abuse , and campaigned aggressively on those themes . </s><s> he contrasted the lack of focus this year with the contract with america that proved so successful in 1994 . </s><s> `` people thought we stood for something pretty big , '' he said . </s><s> but gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about his leadership , repeatedly casting the election results as a victory for his leadership team because republicans had stayed in the majority for three elections in a row for the first time in 70 years . </s><s> he also suggested that those who would challenge him have little support . </s><s> `` the people who normally are quoted on this are people who would in fact take the party to a narrower base , '' gingrich said , referring to the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives about his leadership . </s><s> `` i 'd like to see who it was that had a plan that they were confident over the last 60 days would have been more successful and why they did n't share it .

complex , three-way transaction involving aol , netscape and sun microsystems inc. aol , the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers , would acquire netscape 's popular site on the world wide web and its software business . </s><s> but as part of the deal , aol would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with sun microsystems to strengthen netscape 's other business of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up web pages and other internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time . </s><s> the purchase , an exchange of aol shares for netscape stock , is valued at roughly $ 4 billion . </s><s> a completed deal could be announced as soon as monday morning . </s><s> but executives involved in the talks cautioned sunday night that some details remained to be negotiated . </s><s> the netscape deal , if consummated , would realign three businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services , internet software and electronic commerce . </s><s> it would strengthen two of microsoft 's leading rivals , aol and sun microsystems . </s><s> at the same time , however , it would subsume netscape , an internet software maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to microsoft 's dominance of the personal computer software market . </s><s> netscape , founded in 1994 , has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from microsoft . </s><s> its navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the world wide web . </s><s> but microsoft , responding to the internet revolution , entered the market aggressively , quickly matching the quality of netscape 's technology and then bundling the microsoft browser , internet explorer , into its industry-standard windows operating system and giving it away free . </s><s> earlier this year , netscape announced layoffs and started distributing navigator for free as well , as microsoft steadily gained in the browser market . </s><s> since then , netscape has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction fees from its netcenter web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporations that are building their own internet sites on which to conduct electronic commerce . </s><s> aol believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from netscape 's web site and , helped by sun 's programmers and vast corporate sales force , to accelerate netscape 's software sales as well , executives involved in the negotiations said . </s><s> sun 's version of unix , solaris , is among the most popular operating systems for the large , powerful computers that run netscape 's server software . </s><s> `` this deal would insure that the fundamental elements of netscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its technologies forward , '' said david b. yoffie , a professor at the harvard business school and co-author with michael a. cusumano of the massachusetts institute of technology of a recent book , `` competing on internet time : lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft . '' </s><s> the impact of the deal , if any , on the government 's antitrust suit against microsoft is uncertain . </s><s> it does appear to support a key theme of microsoft 's defense _ namely , that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time . </s><s> thus , microsoft argues , antitrust policy should tread gently . </s><s> but the deal , government officials insist , should have no direct effect on the current case . </s><s> `` no matter how much the alliances shift , it does n't affect the central fact of microsoft 's monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect its monopoly , '' said david boies , the justice department 's lead trial lawyer in the microsoft case . </s><s> executives representing netscape , aol and sun microsystems are government witnesses at the microsoft trial . </s><s> and the serious merger talks between netscape chief executive officer james barksdale and aol chairman steve case began about a month ago , or just after the start of the microsoft trial , according to people close to the talks . </s><s> industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been emboldened to take stronger anti-microsoft steps based partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken microsoft . </s><s> and representatives of kleiner perkins caufield & amp ; byers , a silicon valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among microsoft 's rivals , sit on the boards of netscape , sun and aol .	proposed aol purchase of netscape would strengthen microsoft 's rivals	aol seeks to purchase netscape in move to counter rival microsoft	aol intends to buy netscape and develop partnership with sun microsystems	aol reportedly to purchase netscape , enter partnership with sun

commit u.s. taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $ 30 billion to try to insulate brazil , and with it the rest of latin america , from the worst effects of the financial turmoil circling the globe , according to u.s. and foreign officials assembling the program . </s><s> details of the u.s. contribution , which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees , have yet to be negotiated . </s><s> but several congressional leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration would have to act while congress is in recess . </s><s> this early warning from the administration reflects memories of how congress erupted with objections and hearings in 1995 when president clinton committed $ 20 billion in u.s. funds to the bailout of mexico . </s><s> but administration officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that members of congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic collapse in latin america that would resound in the united states , and thus they expect few objections . </s><s> the timing of an aid package for brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the brazilian government . </s><s> the government of president fernando henrique cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on sunday , which may well determine whether brazil can execute an austerity program that is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating with the international monetary fund . </s><s> the biggest role in the rescue program for brazil will be taken by the international monetary fund , which said last week that it would contribute at least $ 15 billion _ and appears to be under pressure from the united states to do even more . </s><s> another $ 9 billion or so will come from the world bank and the inter-american development bank , and the remainder from the united states and other major industrial nations . </s><s> germany and japan , though , have been reluctant to take part , one u.s. official noted , suggesting that latin america is chiefly washington 's problem , not their own . </s><s> so far , u.s. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to brazil . </s><s> `` brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region , the united states and the international community , and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful , '' treasury secretary robert rubin said on friday . </s><s> but in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil , rubin declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with brazil 's problems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the united states might contribute . </s><s> but he discussed brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that president clinton advocated in speeches to the imf and the world bank here three weeks ago . </s><s> at the time , clinton argued that the monetary fund should `` provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion '' rather than wait for disaster to strike . </s><s> direct u.s. aid to brazil would clearly send a symbolic message : that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund , the united states is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for brazil but to stop chaos spreading to argentina , mexico and other countries that are major u.s. trading partners . </s><s> that would be a change of strategy . </s><s> so far , the united states has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions , chiefly the imf but it would also be a risky move for president clinton , economically and politically . </s><s> even though congress objected to the $ 20 billion in u.s. funds committed to the bailout of mexico , it turned out that only $ 12 billion was ultimately needed , and it has since been paid back , with interest . </s><s> but rubin noted on friday that `` it 's a very different environment now . '' </s><s> other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in congress to direct u.s. participation in a brazil bailout . </s><s> `` i think there are a lot more people in congress who are now scared to death by what 's been happening in the markets , and what could happen in their own districts , '' a white house official said last week , `` and they wo n't say much as long as they do n't have to vote on it . '' </s><s> by acting soon to stabilize latin america , the administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed russia and , at its height , led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from brazil , for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency . </s><s> whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since thailand 's currency crisis in july 1997 is a matter of considerable debate . </s><s> but many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world : two successive interest-rate cuts in the united states , japan 's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $ 500 billion in taxpayer funds , and a steady strengthening of currencies in thailand , indonesia and south korea , the first signs that investors may be preparing to return . </s><s> always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets , rubin acknowledged that `` in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant , positive developments . '' </s><s> but the former trader , burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies , warned that `` serious issues remain '' and that `` it will take some time for the world to work its way out '' of what he has repeatedly called `` the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years . '' </s><s> in fact , rubin 's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic , which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets . </s><s> `` brazil and japan are the two obvious tinderboxes , '' said jeffrey garten , dean of the yale school of management , who served as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during clinton 's first term . </s><s> `` in brazil , the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem . </s><s> and in japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money . '' </s><s> but after spending 18 months in negotiations with the japanese , rubin clearly senses that the united states has little leverage in tokyo ; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock , not lack of resources . </s><s> in brazil , though , the united states has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program , as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to cardoso and his team . </s><s> but demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the exchange stabilization fund , created during the roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar . </s><s> the money is under rubin 's control , with presidential approval , and he reached into it to circumvent congressional objections to aiding mexico in 1995 . </s><s> but the reaction was so strong _ for a time congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts _ that rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since . </s><s> he committed $ 3 billion in a `` second line of defense '' in emergency aid programs for indonesia and south korea last year , but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country . </s><s> u.s. officials said that south korea did not need the extra help , and that the collapse of the suharto government in indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct u.s. aid . </s><s> in the bailout of russia _ whose economy collapsed after president boris yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformers _ the united states offered no direct help . </s><s> those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging markets , and greatly worsened brazil 's troubles . </s><s> so far , brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the imf , convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country . </s><s> but at the same time , the brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get it . </s><s> u.s. officials and top officials of the imf are clearly nervous , worried that the longer the negotiations drag on , the greater will be the risk of brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil . </s><s> `` the brazilians want everyone to think that it 's all under control , '' said an investment banker involved in the talks . </s><s> `` but the fact is that there 's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the government is going to be forced to devalue '' its currency , which is pegged to the dollar , but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall . </s><s> to prevent a sudden devaluation , the brazilian government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent , choking off credit for most companies . </s><s> meanwhile , the country is slipping into recession . </s><s> the aid would buy time for the brazilians , but it is contingent on cardoso 's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits , chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending . </s><s> the first deputy managing director for the international monetary fund , stanley fischer , spent friday in brazil to review the country 's austerity plan , which is expected to be announced after sunday 's elections but before the international package , to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to brazil . </s><s> `` brazil has to do a lot , '' fischer said last week before leaving on his trip . </s><s> `` in return , i expect the international community will make a large contribution .

force bosnia arrest serb general accuse srebrenica genocide	allied force arrest bosnian serb general charge genocide	serb general krstic high military arrest  direct srebrenica attack	bosnian serb general  krstic  seized  war crime tribunal charge genocide	american and allied forces in bosnia on wednesday arrested a bosnian serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment . </s><s> maj. gen. radislav krstic , arrested without incident in the american sector in northeast bosnia , is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far , and the first serving military officer . </s><s> he is accused of directing the attack on srebrenica in 1995 , one of the most chilling and influential events of the bosnian war , when some 7,000 bosnian muslim men were marched off , presumably to their deaths , as u.n. peacekeepers stood by . </s><s> the indictment of krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during and after the fall of srebrenica between july 11 and nov. 1 , 1995 . </s><s> he is indicted both in connection with `` direct personal involvement in the commission of these crimes '' as well as his command responsibility . </s><s> he is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity . </s><s> krstic was a colonel in 1995 , and the deputy commander of the drina battalion , but was promoted to general within days of the fall of srebrenica . </s><s> he is considered a close associate of the bosnian serb commander , gen. ratko mladic , and the former bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , both of whom are wanted by the tribunal . </s><s> and he is considered capable , if he is willing to testify , of implicating yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who has not been indicted . </s><s> louise arbour , chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , called krstic `` a very significant military leader '' and said she was delighted with the arrest . </s><s> the general was only indicted on oct. 30 , tribunal officials said , but the indictment was kept secret so there would be a better chance of a successful arrest . </s><s> nato secretary-general javier solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large `` should realize that they , too , will be brought to justice . '' </s><s> james rubin , the state department spokesman , said that the arrest `` serves as a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes , who remain at large , that they will be held individually accountable for their actions . '' </s><s> the bosnian serbs reacted angrily to the arrest , with the hardline bosnian serb president , nikola poplasen , saying that his government would now reduce contacts with nato-led peacekeeping forces `` to the necessary minimum . '' </s><s> poplasen , who defeated a more moderate candidate backed by washington in september elections , said the arrest of krstic had `` embittered and upset '' the bosnian serbs and would harm the implementation of the dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 bosnian war . </s><s> he said he would protest the arrest , and his remarks were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote . </s><s> a senior official of a nato country called the arrest `` very good news '' and said it was `` a warning to milosevic himself '' and others who have not been publicly indicted that `` the murders committed have not been forgotten . '' </s><s> a pentagon official said the arrest , the most important made in the american sector , `` was a sign that this is a continuing process . '' </s><s> nato-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , four of whom were the subject of sealed indictments . </s><s> there have been numerous calls for the arrest of mladic and karadzic , the two most infamous men indicted , but they normally are accompanied by armed guards . </s><s> nato forces have never tried to arrest them , apparently fearing casualties and an angry public reaction from bosnian serbs . </s><s> officials say that both mladic and karadzic are believed to have left the bosnian serb republic to live in serbia , which is part of yugoslavia and controlled by milosvevic . </s><s> krstic , who was transferred to the hague for trial , is the 35th suspect who has been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there . </s><s> he is the commander of the bosnian serb 5th corps and was arrested while traveling on the road to bijelina . </s><s> at the outset of the war in 1992 , he was an officer of the yugoslav army , and like all senior bosnian serb officers , was transferred to the new bosnian serb force . </s><s> in 1994 , he lost a leg in a mine explosion . </s><s> one bosnian serb official said in a telephone interview that , at the time , krstic had responsibility for `` anti-terrorist units '' who were given some of the most difficult tasks . </s><s> `` srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people do n't talk about it , '' the official said . </s><s> `` but everyone believes it was the anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing . '' </s><s> in banja luka on wednesday , some members of the bosnian serb parliament protested the arrest , saying that krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier . </s><s> ivo daalder , a former bosnia expert on the national security council , now with the brookings institution , said the arrest showed a new and promising coordination between the tribunal and nato troops , given the rapid arrest after the oct. 30 indictment . </s><s> he also said that the arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send an important message . </s><s> srebrenica was a key town in the bosnian conflict . </s><s> it was where the united nations first made a stand in march 1993 , when the commander of u.n. troops personally led a convoy of trucks to the surrounded town and promised the bosnian muslims there that srebrenica would be a `` safe area '' and the united nations would protect them . </s><s> but in july 1995 , the united nations did not protect srebrenica with air strikes , and peacekeeping troops watched as the serbs marched in , separated muslim men and women and marched the men off . </s><s> `` srebrenica signaled the massive failure of the west , '' said daalder . </s><s> `` it galvanized the united states and nato to act . '' </s><s> at a london conference later in july , nato agreed to defend gorazde and remaining safe areas with massive air strikes if necessary . </s><s> after a mortar attack on the sarajevo marketplace in late august , nato air strikes began , signaling the last chapter of the war and leading to the american-brokered dayton accords . </s><s> in sarajevo wednesday , an aide to the bosnian muslim member of the collective presidency , alija izetbegovic , praised the arrest . </s><s> `` we welcome this action , hoping very soon that the time will come for karadzic and mladic to be brought to justice , '' said the aide , mirza jajric . </s><s> the arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member countries of the organization for security and cooperation in europe met in oslo , norway , to discuss the international effort to keep the peace in kosovo , the southern serbian province . </s><s> under a deal pressed on milosevic in october , the organization will provide up to 2,000 civilians to monitor a cease-fire in kosovo and to promote a political settlement there to give kosovo enhanced autonomy . </s><s> macedonia 's government wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 nato troops near its border with kosovo . </s><s> those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid of the civilian monitors if necessary .	u.s. forces in bosnia arrest serb general accused of srebrenica genocide .	allied forces arrest bosnian serb general charged with genocide	serb general krstic highest military arrest .  directed srebrenica attack .	bosnian serb general , krstic , seized - war crimes tribunal charges genocide
