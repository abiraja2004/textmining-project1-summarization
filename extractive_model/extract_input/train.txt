but unstated objectives of last august 's raid on afghanistan was to kill osama bin laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible , administration officials now acknowledge . </s><s> according to the officials , white house lawyers conducted a secret review in the months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal under u.s. and international law . </s><s> the officials said the raid was timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin laden 's camps at the moment when the central intelligence agency believed he would be meeting there with his chief operatives . </s><s> a 1976 executive order bars anyone working for the u.s. government from plotting or carrying out assassinations . </s><s> but officials said the white house legal opinion drafted before the afghan strike asserts that the president has authority to target the `` infrastructure '' of terrorist groups that are attacking americans . </s><s> a top u.s. counterterrorism official said this week that the infrastructure of bin laden 's group is mostly `` human . '' </s><s> `` as we said from the time of the aug. 20 strike , the objective was to disrupt the training , organization and infrastructure of the bin laden terrorist network at the khost camps , '' said david c. leavy , a spokesman for the national security council at the white house . </s><s> targeting infrastructure , officials acknowledged , can also mean destroying the leadership of a terrorist group . </s><s> `` command and control of an enemy is a justifiable target , '' leavy said . </s><s> senior administration officials said they never discussed killing bin laden in their planning sessions . </s><s> his death , they said in interviews after the attack , would simply have been a side benefit . </s><s> u.s. intelligence officials say they now believe that bin laden was in the camp on the day of the attack , but he appears to have left unscathed before the missiles hit . </s><s> officials said there were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have died in the attack , and that total casualties in the complex were between 50 and 100 . </s><s> administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction between attempting to kill a specific person like bin laden and attacking a group of people who command a terrorist organization . </s><s> administration officials have denied since august that the raid was intended to kill bin laden , a saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors with leading a global war against u.s. interests . </s><s> he has been linked to the aug. 7 bombing of two u.s. embassies in east africa . </s><s> but a less subtle explanation was offered on oct. 13 by defense secretary william cohen , who said during a visit to saudi arabia that the united states had been `` going after '' bin laden and his colleagues . </s><s> `` we were n't quite successful , '' cohen continued , `` but we sent a message . '' </s><s> kenneth bacon , the pentagon spokesman , said the secretary had not retracted his statements . </s><s> the los angeles times recently reported that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use deadly force against terrorist leaders . </s><s> bin laden 's organization was a significant concern for the clinton administration even before the bombing of the u.s. embassies in east africa . </s><s> last spring , officials said , u.s. intelligence considered a daring raid into afghanistan to capture the saudi exile . </s><s> officials said that at roughly the same time , the white house drafted the legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership . </s><s> that review , officials said , provided the legal basis in august to fire cruise missiles into the meeting at which it was believed bin laden and his lieutenants would be gathered . </s><s> the review , by the national security council , was the basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations . </s><s> that ban was imposed by president ford in 1975 , after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the cia had plotted to assassinate fidel castro , the cuban leader , and others . </s><s> the order said : `` no person employed by , or acting on behalf of the united states government shall engage in , or conspire to engage in , assassination . '' </s><s> while it is , on its face , a sweeping and unqualified ban , it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over the years . </s><s> in 1986 , the reagan administration responded to a terrorist attack against u.s. soldiers in germany with a bombing raid on libya . </s><s> the targets included the residence of the libyan leader , moammar gadhafi . </s><s> and in the gulf war , u.s. forces used powerful bombs in an attempt to kill saddam hussein , the president of iraq . </s><s> the legal review conducted by the white house would appear to provide a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances .	one goal of afghanistan raid was to kill osama bin laden	objective of august raid on afghanistan was to kill bin laden and his men .	u.s. admits osama bin laden and lieutenants the object of august attack	aug attack on al qaeda camp rekindles assassination debate ; legal or not ?

network	summer 1997  east african bin laden network worry security	dispatch osama bin laden operative give insight terrorist network	1997  terrorist computer  bin laden cell kenya  somalia attack  fear us	sometime in the summer of 1997 , an operative for osama bin laden sat down at his personal computer in a hideaway in kenya . </s><s> he was worried , he wrote in an angry dispatch , about the security of the `` east africa network '' of bin laden , the saudi exile accused of masterminding a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against americans . </s><s> the organization , the author complained , had declared war against the united states , yet he had learned of that only from the news media . </s><s> the writer , who federal authorities believe was haroun fazil , who was to become one of the central suspects in the bombing of the u.s. embassy in nairobi a year later , noted with alarm british press reports about the arrest of an aide to bin laden . </s><s> striking almost bureaucratic tones , he said he was worried that `` an important man with close links '' to bin laden , seemed to have `` fallen into the enemy 's hands . '' </s><s> he said the americans were breathing down the necks of his associates in nairobi and that he had to take precautions . </s><s> `` the cell is at 100 percent danger , '' the operative warned . </s><s> the letter , an extraordinary bit of digital evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case , was retrieved from a computer in a house where fazil had been staying , according to papers filed in u.s. district court in new york city . </s><s> the papers said the computer was seized in august 1997 in a raid by kenyan authorities that was attended by an fbi agent . </s><s> the documents did not make clear whether the fbi had translated and read the document before or after the bombings of the u.s. embassies in nairobi and dar es salaam , tanzania , on aug. 7 of this year . </s><s> the timing is potentially important because there have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the united states adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist attack on american targets in kenya . </s><s> officials of the fbi and the u.s. attorney 's office in new york city refused to say tuesday night at what point fbi agents learned of the computer file , nor would they make any other comment . </s><s> fazil eluded american investigators after the bombing as he traveled from kenya to his home in the comoros islands and then to the middle east . </s><s> he remains a fugitive . </s><s> the dispatch provides a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the twilight of the 20th century . </s><s> the author talks of how he and his fellow operatives follow events on cnn and use the internet to communicate . </s><s> he refers to himself as the media information officer of the east africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on big decisions . </s><s> along the way , in an almost casual fashion , the document seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against bin laden : that he had planted a terrorist cell in nairobi and that his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin laden 's door by federal authorities _ the attacks on american soldiers in somalia in 1993 and 1994 . </s><s> the writer of the document warned that the followers of bin laden , whom he referred to as `` the sheik , '' had `` become america 's primary target . '' </s><s> he said his comrades in east africa `` should know that there is an american-kenyan-egyptian intelligence activity in nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of the members who are associated with the sheik since america knows well that the youth who lived in somalia and were members of the sheik 's cell are the ones who killed americans in somalia . '' </s><s> `` they know that since kenya was the main gateway for those members , there must be a center in kenya , '' he wrote , concluding : `` we are really in danger . '' </s><s> the government has asserted that one of fazil 's duties was to prepare and transmit reports to bin laden and his top lieutenants . </s><s> federal authorities said that khalid al fawwaz , a london-based associate of bin laden , directed fazil to `` report periodically to bin laden about the `` security '' situation of the cell . </s><s> fawwaz , who served as an informal press spokesman for bin laden in london , was arrested by british authorities in september after the embassy bombings . </s><s> he has denied any connection to terrorist activities . </s><s> a translation of the report was part of a package of documents american prosecutors have sent to britain to support the extradition of fawwaz for trial in new york . </s><s> it is not clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded to bin laden . </s><s> the documents , which were initially filed in secret , include a federal complaint that accuses fawwaz of conspiring with bin laden to kill americans overseas . </s><s> a second count charges him with soliciting others to do so . </s><s> the report made clear that the organization was being run on a shoestring . </s><s> its author wrote that his mother has fallen ill , and that he would like to return to his homeland for a visit . </s><s> `` what do you think ? </s><s> keep in mind we only have $ 500 . '' </s><s> he repeatedly expressed his fears of american intelligence , which he believed was in the midst of a worldwide search for bin laden and his associates . </s><s> `` there is a war and the situation is dangerous , '' he said . </s><s> he wrote that american forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national security or american citizens . </s><s> the author noted with alarm a recent cia operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees had been lured across the border in pakistan and returned to the united states for trial . </s><s> according to federal authorities , fazil went on to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the nairobi embassy . </s><s> prosecutors assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed the embassy 's security precautions . </s><s> on aug. 7 , they charge , fazil drove a pickup truck to the embassy , leading the way for a vehicle carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people , including 12 americans . </s><s> the author of the report said that he stood ready to `` fight the forces of atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth . '' </s><s> he said that the group did not have to inform its nairobi-based operatives of all its global plans , but they needed enough warning to go `` underground for a while '' if authorities intensified the pressure in nairobi . </s><s> `` we , the east africa cell members , do not want to know about the operations plans , '' he wrote , `` since we are just implementers .

saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in u.s. district court in manhattan . </s><s> according to the government , the informant worked closely with bin laden from 1989 to 1996 , a period when prosecutors assert that bin laden was ordering deadly attacks on u.s. soldiers in somalia and elsewhere . </s><s> from the court papers filed in the investigation of

labor dispute player  salary cap	nba cancel 144 preseason game  start regular season also doubt	nba labor talk collapse  preseason cancel  work stoppage threaten	in a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage in national basketball association history , the league monday announced the cancellation of all 114 preseason games . </s><s> citing stalled negotiations with the players association over a new collective bargaining agreement , league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games . </s><s> while the decision had been expected for 10 days , it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute . </s><s> both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts . </s><s> privately , officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled on nov. 3 or even before december . </s><s> unlike major league baseball , the national football league and the national hockey league , the nba has never lost a regular-season game to labor strife . </s><s> `` since we 're not even negotiating , you have to conclude it 's very likely that we 're going miss some part of the regular season , '' deputy commissioner russ granik said monday night . </s><s> `` we 'll try and defer any decisions until the last minute , but right now it does not look good . '' </s><s> the two sides will meet on thursday _ their first official bargaining session since aug. 6 . </s><s> commissioner david stern and a group of owners walked out of a meeting after dismissing the merits of a new proposal from the players . </s><s> neither granik nor players association executive director billy hunter sounded as if this week 's meeting would go a long way toward the signing of a new agreement _ the precursor to playing again . </s><s> `` i do n't think you have any choice but to miss games at this point , '' hunter said . </s><s> `` in fact , i think the they 've intended it all along . </s><s> they 've locked us out , they 've refused to negotiate and they 've given us a proposal that 's ludicrous . '' </s><s> not only are both sides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before oct. 18 - the fordham law school dean john feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 players with $ 800 million in guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout _ but the owners and players also are making time to win public opinion before they test their fans ' loyalties by canceling games . </s><s> monday in 11 cities throughout the country , the players are holding make-shift press conferences at training-camp venues , nba arenas and gymnasiums . </s><s> patrick ewing , the union president , and several teammates will speak at suny-purchase in purchase , n.y. , where the knicks train during the season . </s><s> with training camp originally scheduled to open on oct. 6 , the message from the players is clear : if the owners would call an end to the lockout , we would be ready to play today . </s><s> about 100 players are expected to attend , speak and sign autographs for fans afterward . </s><s> `` i wish they would put their energies into trying to negotiate a deal rather than the various other things that they 've been doing , '' granik said . </s><s> the dispute is essentially over how the owners and players will judiciously divvy up $ 2 billion in income . </s><s> it began last year with the contention by the owners that their employees were receiving more than their fair share of the pot . </s><s> the owners were allowed to terminate the current agreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player salaries reached 53.8 percent of total basketball-related income . </s><s> the owners say that figure is currently hovering around 57.1 percent . </s><s> though many economic issues need to be resolved , the main point of contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared a lockout on july 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their own free agents whatever they want , regardless of salary-cap rules governing the nba 's 29 teams . </s><s> called the larry bird exception , it was created to allow the hall of fame boston celtics forward to re-sign with the celtics near the end of his career . </s><s> michael jordan exercised the clause the last two years with the chicago bulls , earning more than $ 30 million per season _ figures more than $ 5 million more what a team is allowed to spend on all its players . </s><s> but with exorbitant salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and $ 100 million deals sprouting up routinely , the owners are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn . </s><s> `` last year , the players received about $ 1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four years , '' granik said in a prepared statement . </s><s> `` our proposals would result in an average player salary of more than $ 3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $ 750,000 . </s><s> unfortunately , the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we have offered . '' </s><s> hunter labeled those claims as optimistic projections , and shot down a number of new proposals presented to the players on sept. 25 . </s><s> `` if they had left the current deal in place , we would have gotten much of that anyway , '' he added . </s><s> `` all we 're saying is , we 're not in position to accept a hard cap . '' </s><s> monday 's decision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the nba indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week of exhibition games . </s><s> through tickets sales alone , granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $ 35 million and $ 40 million . </s><s> decisions about the cancellations of regular season games are expected to be made next week , he added . </s><s> a league official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two weeks , depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations . </s><s> thursday 's bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the season on time . </s><s> `` hurdles could be overcome very quickly , but i have no reason to believe they will on thursday , '' granik said . </s><s> added hunter : `` of course they do n't expect much to get done . </s><s> when russ and david decide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive , then something will happen . </s><s> what they 're banking on now is that the players are going to miss paychecks and cave in november . </s><s> it 's as if they 've ingested something that has to pass . </s><s> and once it passes , then they 'll negotiate .

time history nba game cancel	the national basketball association , embroiled in a labor dispute with its players , tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season . </s><s> it is the first time in the league 's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games . </s><s> the nba 's deputy commissioner , russ granik , announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a manhattan hotel . </s><s> the decision to cancel 99 games between nov. 3 and nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap , a proposal the owners said they would respond to by friday . </s><s> `` we tried our best today to try to do what was possible to salvage the season , '' said alonzo mourning , the miami heat center . </s><s> `` unfortunately , it did n't work out . '' </s><s> after 35,001 games without a blemish , the nba now joins the national hockey league , the national football league and major league baseball in having lost games to a labor dispute . </s><s> taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts , the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations . </s><s> `` i 'm very sad and disappointed , '' said the nba commissioner , david stern . </s><s> `` i consider it to be a collective failure , but i honestly do n't know what else we could have done . </s><s> i do things that i like to think are in the best interests of the game . </s><s> and i believe this is . '' </s><s> the decision came after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player july 1 . </s><s> seventeen players , including union president patrick ewing and vice presidents mitch richmond , herb williams , dikemebe mutombo and ty corbin , attended the meeting along with stern , granik and five members of the ownership committee _ madison square garden president dave checketts and owners abe pollin of washington , gordon gund of cleveland , les alexander of houston and jerry colangelo of phoenix . </s><s> the talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league 's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners . </s><s> the dispute involves the distribution of approximately $ 2 billion in league-wide income . </s><s> the main sticking point has been the owners ' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions , the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries ' in line with revenue growth . </s><s> while the players did not discuss the elimination of the larry bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation proposal . </s><s> the main points were as follows : _ a 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $ 18 million , a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their bird rights . </s><s> for example , if a player made $ 20 million , the team would be forced to put $ 1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams . </s><s> `` there could be provisions made for some players , '' said jeffrey kessler , the chief outside counsel for the union . </s><s> `` we do n't want to do anything that would encourage chicago from getting michael jordan back . </s><s> and i think the league feels the same way . '' </s><s> the proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiations , but it would not be nearly as liberal . </s><s> _ a salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary . </s><s> whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year . </s><s> if the figure was $ 29 million over the salary cap , then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $ 1 million less than the previous season . </s><s> but the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $ 2 million before the credit goes into effect . </s><s> _ also , if the 63-percent threshold is met , a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts . </s><s> players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues . </s><s> the union said this clearly addresses the league 's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues . </s><s> since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries , the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal . </s><s> _ teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies , meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal . </s><s> currently , the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his bird rights after two seasons _ a clause kevin garnett parlayed into an astronomical $ 126 million deal last year with minnesota . </s><s> _ finally , the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance . </s><s> details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs , a provision the owners included in their last proposal . </s><s> in return for the concessions , the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $ 272,500 _ and creation of an average salary exception . </s><s> this would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary _ currently $ 2.6 million . </s><s> `` we 're buoyed by the fact for the first time they 've decided to submit a counterproposal , '' the union 's executive director , billy hunter , said . </s><s> `` i do n't know if i 'm more optimistic , but i can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we made a valiant effort . '' </s><s> asked if the players would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games , hunter added : `` it 's not about us blinking . </s><s> we want to reach an agreement . </s><s> we 're tired of the rhetoric , we 're tired of the game-playing . </s><s> our position all along has been we do n't want to accept a bad deal . '' </s><s> granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason games . </s><s> he estimated the losses into the `` hundreds of millions of dollars . '' </s><s> `` i think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically , '' he added . </s><s> `` but there 's some possibility . '' </s><s> added stern , `` we owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted . </s><s> it does n't look promising , but we 're going to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response . '' </s><s> though the decision to cancel games was not surprising , it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates . </s><s> both sides reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and preserving the nba 's perfect record . </s><s> tuesday , they could not come to such an accord . </s><s> `` i 'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel , '' granik said . </s><s> `` but unless this or something else works , or there 's some dramatic breakthrough , i think that is certainly not all of the season that 's in jeopardy .

guaranteed contracts will find out monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout , a long-awaited arbitrator 's decision that may affect leverage in the league 's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on american sports-labor law . </s><s> but neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator , john feerick , to speed up negotiations , especially if feerick finds in favor of the players , an award that could approach $ 800 million in salaries . </s><s> nba attorneys have indicated to the union that if the decision goes against management , they will seek to have it vacated by appealing to the u.s. district court in manhattan and then , if necessary , to the 2nd u.s . </s><s> circuit court of appeals , a process that could prevent the players from getting paid for several months . </s><s> the nba has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season because of the labor dispute . </s><s> the league has other litigation pending in u.s. district court in manhattan . </s><s> if the players win the ruling , the nba intends to renew its motion to disqualify feerick . </s><s> the motion was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement existed and , therefore , he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter . </s><s> `` if he rules in our favor , i think it emboldens the spirit and the resolve of the players , '' said billy hunter , union executive director . </s><s> `` but we understand that wo n't end the lockout . </s><s> it just means they have to pay 200-some players . </s><s> and there is still other litigation alive that may take a while to resolve . </s><s> at most , it 's a hollow victory . '' </s><s> feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render his decision . </s><s> whatever he decides , his ruling will be watched carefully . </s><s> there is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid . </s><s> during the nba summer lockout of 1995 , players who missed paychecks did not file a grievance . </s><s> neither did national hockey league players who were locked out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season . </s><s> the union argued that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player contracts . </s><s> in support of its arguments , the union pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment during a lockout . </s><s> the league is relying on the basic tenets of labor law , which hold that employees not be paid during strikes or lockouts . </s><s> a ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners . </s><s> the deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement . </s><s> if feerick finds in favor of the players , there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to reach an agreement quickly . </s><s> they would essentially be paid for not playing basketball . </s><s> if feerick finds in favor of the owners , the reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly . </s><s> but hunter disputed this notion , and in a conference call friday talked openly about the entire season 's being canceled before the players would back away from their ultimate goals . </s><s> `` i 'm not at all concerned , '' hunter said . </s><s> `` there 's been no demonstration that there 's going to be a change in our resolve . </s><s> after the players saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by nba owners , well , i had two players call me up and tell me , if need be , they 'd be willing to hock everything they 've got . '' </s><s> another significant development may be thedeparture of many players to europe until the dispute is settled , according to at least two player agents . </s><s> `` i think it would be a case-by-case basis , but yes , there 's already some people talking about that , '' said bill strickland , a member of the union 's agents advisory committee . </s><s> steve kauffman , another member of the committee , said he would explore the possibility that one client , nets center rony seikaly , would sign with a professional team in greece . </s><s> `` we would n't look to void his deal with the team , '' kauffman said . </s><s> `` but we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract . ' </s><s> russ granik , nba deputy commissioner , said the league has approved the idea of players ' earning a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled . </s><s> proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout began july 1 . </s><s> but both sides have termed the figures in each other 's proposal as unacceptable , and it was unclear whether either side was willing compromise . </s><s> `` i do n't think we should get too carried away about the possibilities just yet , '' granik said . </s><s> `` when they explored the idea of a tax system , we were taking the players at their word that they wanted to make some headway . </s><s> but to call their first proposal meaningless is charitable . </s><s> they proposed something that has no impact . </s><s> as it stands , that ca n't be the solution .

best paid , not those who make union scale , that are dominating the discussion . </s><s> and here it is some of the workers , not the management , who are considering trying to make the union

for rookies or $ 272,000 for veterans . </s><s> the number of players making $ 1 million to $ 2 million a year _ the middle class , in nba terms _ fell sharply . </s><s> but michael jordan made $ 33

was adopted , it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay . </s><s> but it has not worked out that way . </s><s> in the current negotiation , the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 percent over the next four years , from $ 1 billion to $ 1.2 billion , and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players want , whether

global economy vs capitol control  reform  quick fix	in little more than a week , the world 's leaders will converge on this businesslike city in the heart of southeast asia for the annual meeting of the asia pacific economic cooperation forum . </s><s> they could hardly be meeting in a more provocative place . </s><s> on sept. 1 , malaysia discontinued trading in its currency , the ringgit , and imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets , particularly on investment from overseas . </s><s> in doing so , the malaysian prime minister , mahathir mohamad , in effect slammed the door on the global economy that president clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion . </s><s> mahathir 's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy makers , who warned that malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out when asia finally recovered from the regional malaise . </s><s> now , though , mahathir 's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life into the country 's moribund economy . </s><s> malaysia 's foreign reserves rose strongly in september , and there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again . </s><s> `` it 's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls , the economy has improved , '' said zainal aznam yusof , the deputy director of the institute of strategic and international studies , a research organization here that helped draft the policies . </s><s> `` but we want to see whether this is strongly sustainable . '' </s><s> critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to malaysia 's economy . </s><s> because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows and currency fluctuations , they said , the government had been able to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending . </s><s> still , the mere fact that malaysia 's experiment has yielded some positive results guarantees that the issue will come up during the apec meeting . </s><s> with mahathir leading the campaign , the cause of capital controls will have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin of westerners . </s><s> `` mahathir is a very outspoken political leader , '' said chia yew boon , an independent analyst in singapore . </s><s> `` there is no way the likes of clinton or jiang zemin are going to be able to muzzle him , '' he added , referring to president jiang of china . </s><s> policy-makers in the united states have expressed fears that if malaysia 's gambit is seen as successful , other economically weakened countries in the region , like indonesia , might be tempted to try it . </s><s> so far , indonesian officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised by the international monetary fund , which stresses economic austerity and open markets . </s><s> but officials in japan have expressed some sympathy for mahathir 's policies , while paul krugman , an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology , has advocated using them as an emergency measure . </s><s> yusof said recent events had vindicated malaysia 's contention that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial system . </s><s> he said the recent near-collapse of a prominent american hedge fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive consequences . </s><s> the long-term capital management hedge fund , based in greenwich , conn. , was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in russia prompted a flight of capital out of that country . </s><s> `` the ltcm fiasco really provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy , '' yusof said . </s><s> with capital controls as protection , yusof said malaysia was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy . </s><s> in addition to growing foreign reserves , he said malaysia had improved its trade balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods . </s><s> foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned malaysia , as experts had predicted they would . </s><s> while foreign direct investment fell in september _ to $ 142 million , from an average monthly rate of $ 321 million for the period from january through september _ it did not dry up completely . </s><s> for every comforting statistic , though , the critics produce an alarming one . </s><s> they said the increase in malaysia 's foreign reserves was merely due to the new capital restrictions , which stipulated that malaysian currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated by sept. 30 . </s><s> the skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in september , despite several reductions in interest rates . </s><s> so the consumers who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into their savings , which means the buying spree will end when their savings are depleted . </s><s> `` the argument was that by imposing capital controls , you 'd regain control over monetary policy , which would increase the supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch , '' said k.s . </s><s> jomo , a professor of political economy at the university of malaya here . </s><s> `` but that 's not happening . '' </s><s> the biggest flaw in malaysia 's policy , jomo and others said , is its timing . </s><s> with the asian crisis more than a year old , much of the foreign capital that was in the country has already gone . </s><s> the critics said mahathir had spooked would-be investors without even locking in the ones who used to be here . </s><s> `` there is a case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls , but to avert a crisis , not to respond to one , '' jomo said . </s><s> in fact , other asian currencies , like the indonesian rupiah and the thai baht , have actually rebounded since malaysia suspended trading in its currency and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar . </s><s> analysts liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that has come and gone . </s><s> more important , the capital controls are slowing down much-needed corporate and banking reforms . </s><s> the government 's rescue of renong , a major conglomerate with close ties to mahathir , is going ahead , though some analysts predict the government will eventually scrap the much-criticized plan . </s><s> the rescue of politically connected companies remains a tense issue here . </s><s> on monday , during the trial of malaysia 's former deputy prime minister , anwar ibrahim , on charges of corruption and sex-related crimes , anwar angrily denied mahathir 's claim that he had approved the bailout . </s><s> anwar 's sensational trial is a reminder that mahathir 's economic policies can not be disentangled from politics . </s><s> malaysia 's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with his former protege over how to respond to the asian crisis , and he dismissed anwar the day after imposing capital controls . </s><s> during boom times , mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner language . </s><s> in a speech on monday , he attacked a familiar target , saying foreign currency traders `` are the cause of the currency turmoil , '' adding : `` they spread it worldwide . </s><s> they precipitated the current recession in every country .

stability	anwar arrest harm mahathir s 17year legacy  spurs riot  market downturn	among asia 's leaders , prime minister mahathir mohamad was notable as a man with a bold vision : a physical and social transformation that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs . </s><s> it almost came true . </s><s> in 17 years as prime minister , mahathir , 72 , who is a medical doctor , fostered an economic liberalization that led to some of the world 's fastest rates of growth . </s><s> he drove malaysians to be more productive , to embrace high technology and to begin major investments around the world . </s><s> he created a national affirmative-action program that allowed the country 's ethnic chinese , malays and indians to share in improved living standards and a new sense of malaysian identity and pride . </s><s> this year was to have been mahathir 's year of triumph , perhaps paving the way for his retirement , with the inauguration of huge public works projects and impressive gatherings of foreign leaders and sportsmen . </s><s> but today , in a dizzying turnaround , malaysia is on asia 's critical list , its economy teetering on the edge of disaster and its stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely avoidable political cat fight . </s><s> last month , mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent , anwar ibrahim , 51 , accusing him of corruption and illegal sex acts . </s><s> the move set off street demonstrations and aroused international condemnation , particularly from anwar 's many friends in foreign governments . </s><s> one of the region 's most stable and prosperous nations is suddenly in an uproar . </s><s> it appears that as in indonesia , thailand , japan and south korea , the pressures of economic collapse have spawned a political crisis . </s><s> in all those nations , the result was a change in leadership . </s><s> the question now is : is mahathir next ? </s><s> the answer is far from clear . </s><s> unlike in indonesia , there has been little evidence of a simmering discontent in malaysia . </s><s> the ouster of former president suharto in indonesia had been predicted by many people . </s><s> almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here . </s><s> malaysia is not familiar with political demonstrations . </s><s> unlike indonesians , malaysians rarely riot . </s><s> many people here were puzzled and disturbed when they encountered water cannon and the riot police on the streets in recent weeks . </s><s> `` what we 're seeing is unprecedented , '' said ambassador john malott of the united states . </s><s> `` this has never happened in malaysia , and nobody knows where it 's going to go . </s><s> you can write a lot of scenarios but we are in totally uncharted waters . '' </s><s> mahathir , the confident nation-builder , seems to be flailing as he watches his legacy crumble . </s><s> an economy that had been growing at more than 8 percent a year for the last decade is now headed for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent . </s><s> angry and frustrated , he closed malaysia off from international financial markets one month ago , turning his back on the foreign investors whom he once embraced and who had fueled the country 's rapid growth . </s><s> the move had the intended effect of bringing home the malaysian currency , insulating it from the speculators mahathir blames for the crisis , and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy . </s><s> it is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of the economic orthodoxy of the international monetary fund . </s><s> but few foreign economists expect it to work for long . </s><s> `` mahathir is attacking the fundamental beliefs of the free market , of capitalism , of wall street , '' a foreign diplomat said . </s><s> `` we are either watching economic theory being rewritten or reconfirmed _ and i do n't think it 's being rewritten . '' </s><s> the day after making his economic gamble , mahathir set off the most severe political crisis of his tenure , dismissing anwar , the man he had been grooming to be his successor . </s><s> two weeks later , anwar was arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 days , during which he says he was beaten by his jailers . </s><s> last week he was charged with 10 counts of corruption and sexual misconduct that could result in a prison term of up to 34 years . </s><s> the harshness of those moves unleashed a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized anwar 's motley fellow constituencies : liberal democrats , young professionals and politically assertive muslims . </s><s> for the first time in decades , malaysians by the thousands demonstrated in the streets and in mosques and were met with tear gas and water cannon . </s><s> many people were beaten and hundreds were detained , although most were later released . </s><s> with the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement , the fear expressed by one western diplomat is of a `` downward spiral '' in which `` suppression breeds more discontent breeds more suppression breeds more discontent . '' </s><s> people here whisper that mahathir 's days may now be numbered . </s><s> but few venture a guess at what the number might be . </s><s> given his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or leadership in the opposition , mahathir could ride out the storm as anwar 's trial proceeds . </s><s> but he has struck a harsh blow to the morale of his own nation , to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard to build under the slogan `` malaysia can ! '' </s><s> in this generally decorous nation , the depth of anger expressed by two men who once called each other father and son is disturbing to hear . </s><s> anwar , says the prime minister , is `` despicable '' and `` a sodomist . '' </s><s> mahathir , says his former deputy , is `` senile '' and `` insane . '' </s><s> malaysians , who have stolidly accepted mahathir 's authoritarian rule with a mixture of gratitude and emerging pride , seem stunned .	malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad : from fame to failure	mahathir 's 17 years saw great advances ; now economic crisis , instability .	malaysian leader 's arrest of heir-apparent undoes years of social stability	anwar arrest harms mahathir 's 17-year legacy ; spurs riots , market downturn

milosevic of yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance , military observers and diplomats say . </s><s> milosevic , who on one hand is excoriated by washington as the scourge of kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace in bosnia , acted as the european union , nato and the united nations prepared for a review on monday of possible military intervention . </s><s> russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission to see the yugoslav president sunday in belgrade . </s><s> as he has so often , milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of time and yet still accomplished what he wanted . </s><s> this weekend , foreign diplomatic observers in kosovo reported that a `` military stand-down '' had taken place in the province , where milosevic 's forces have waged a fierce offensive against albanian rebels . </s><s> the observers said that except for segments of three brigades , most units of the yugoslav army were `` home . '' </s><s> the daily reports of the observer mission , made up of u.s. , european union and russian military experts , are one of the key elements in helping washington and european capitals decide whether milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire . </s><s> by putting the army back in its barracks , sending some police units out of kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages , milosevic may well avoid a nato attack , diplomats here and in washington said . </s><s> but at the same time , they acknowledge that while nato looked the other way , he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the kosovo liberation army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for kosovo and its ethnic albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian population that supports it . </s><s> his military operation created more than 250,000 refugees , whom the clinton administration is gearing up to take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations . </s><s> u.s. officials said they expected richard holbrooke , the u.s. envoy who dealt with milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in bosnia , to meet with him on monday to discuss a political plan for kosovo . </s><s> the heart of the disagreement in kosovo is between serbia , yugoslavia 's principal republic , which insists on keeping kosovo as a province , and the ethnic albanians there who have chafed under milosevic 's repression since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989 , and who now seek independence . </s><s> the west , fearing the precedent that independence for kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world , has been trying to mediate a middle course . </s><s> in essence , diplomats said they believed that the plan holbrooke will present to milosevic calls for a three-year interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy arrangement . </s><s> since the kosovo conflict flared up in march , critics of washington 's policy toward milosevic argue that he has been able to choreograph every move to suit his goal : pushing the albanian population into submission with impunity . </s><s> `` the united states and its allies have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the kosovo liberation army , '' said morton abramowitz , head of the international crisis group , a policy analysis organization , `` and taken three weeks to discuss military action , with the result that 500 albanian villages were destroyed . '' </s><s> administration officials now acknowledge that when nato failed to live up to its earlier threat in june to strike serbia , milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces , whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swaths of kosovo territory , including key roads . </s><s> while he was doing that , milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for washington : he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring albania and macedonia , fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area . </s><s> all along , the biggest fear in washington has been that the kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage albania and the ethnic albanian population in macedonia to join the cause . </s><s> such a possibility raised the specter of a new balkans conflict just three years after peace was secured in bosnia . </s><s> milosevic catered to washington 's concern that the conflict be contained . </s><s> the yugoslav army mined kosovo 's borders with macedonia and albania , ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels . </s><s> the yugoslav leader also understood that washington was unsure about how to deal with the disorganized albanian political leadership in kosovo and the unbending kosovo liberation army , whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from switzerland and germany . </s><s> for example , holbrooke persuaded milosevic to meet in may with ibrahim rugova , the top albanian political leader in kosovo , an encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity . </s><s> for that procedural breakthrough , holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in serbia that had been put in place the month before . </s><s> after meeting with rugova , milosevic stepped up his military operations in kosovo , forcing washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban . </s><s> in late june , holbrooke met with two self-styled kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province 's western town of junik but then broke off all contact . </s><s> clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that nato intervention would bolster the separatist forces . </s><s> to try to put the best face on the situation , washington worked with moscow to get milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol kosovo and report on military action . </s><s> the monitors were slow in getting organized . </s><s> by august , when the yugoslav army , backed by the serbian special police , were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process , the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the fighting . </s><s> they drove up to roadblocks , knew something was going on from the sounds and the smoke , but could not be precise . </s><s> in recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn , access has improved , the monitors say . </s><s> but there are some areas in central kosovo around likovac and gornje obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of land mines on the roads . </s><s> the mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas . </s><s> gornje obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic albanian women , children and elderly people on sept. 26 . </s><s> a british reporter who walked across fields into the village on sunday said about 10 mortar shells , apparently from the serbian police or the yugoslav army , were fired at the village early sunday afternoon . </s><s> the yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the kosovo conflict , said a report by new york-based group human rights watch , released here on sunday . </s><s> the report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions . </s><s> but the violations by the guerrillas were on a `` lesser scale '' than the government abuses , the author of the report , fred abrahams , concluded . </s><s> the report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police forces on three ethnic albanian villages in late february and early march in the drenica region of central kosovo . </s><s> at least 83 people , including 24 women and children , were killed in the attack , which involved helicopters , artillery and armored personnel carriers . </s><s> in the yugoslav capital , belgrade , which is a four-hour drive north through rolling countryside from kosovo 's capital of pristina , milosevic remains politically secure . </s><s> that is in part , his domestic critics say , because diplomats like holbrooke and the head of the u.n.refugee agency , sadako ogata , insist on going to see him , thus enhancing his stature .	yugoslav military ordered back

nato attack	us envoy tell milosevic pull back military  let albanian refugee return	american envoy personally tell milsevic must pull back kosovo	milosovic must return military force base avoid nato attack	the american envoy richard holbrooke met with president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia monday night and according to american diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in kosovo province or face a nato attack . </s><s> milosevic was also told , the diplomats said , that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home . </s><s> most of these refugees are reluctant to return because many of the serb police officers who destroyed their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods . </s><s> after delivering his sternest message so far to milosevic over the kosovo conflict , holbrooke said at a news conference that nato 's military plans for attacking serbia were moving ahead on a `` serious , intense and sustained basis . '' </s><s> holbrooke 's mission to milosevic was described by the american diplomats as `` not a do or die trip , '' but they added , `` we 're at a very serious juncture . '' </s><s> shortly after holbrooke 's meeting with milosevic , the yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on serbian television in which he said the `` threats of aggression '' outlined by holbrooke represented `` a criminal act . '' </s><s> milosevic , who rarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast an unusually ominous tone , also said that holbrooke 's position constituted `` support for albanian terrorists and not the albanian people . '' </s><s> milosevic was apparently accusing holbrooke of supporting the ethnic albanian guerrillas of the kosovo liberation army , who have been fighting to make the serbian province of kosovo an independent nation . </s><s> the yugoslav leader added that `` for more than seven days there have been no skirmishes or military action . '' </s><s> an american diplomat familiar with the themes holbrooke planned to stress to milosevic said there had been no expectation that the american envoy would walk out monday night with an agreement . </s><s> rather , the point was to underscore to the yugoslav leader and make explicit what was expected of him . </s><s> `` it was not quite an ultimatum , '' the diplomat said , `` but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance . '' </s><s> the essence of holbrooke 's demands centered on issues outlined in a united nations security council resolution of two weeks ago . </s><s> the resolution ordered milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police forces that were sent to kosovo to deal with the guerrillas and to send back to their bases the military forces normally stationed in the province . </s><s> so far , american diplomats said , milosevic has withdrawn troops from the field but not all of them are in their barracks . </s><s> such a move is essential , american diplomats said , to create a conducive atmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of the province . </s><s> the u.n. resolution also calls for a political solution . </s><s> holbrooke and the u.s. ambassador to macedonia , christopher hill , discussed with milosevic a political document drawn up by the state department that calls for broad autonomy for kosovo . </s><s> milosevic withdrew the autonomy in 1989 as he began his campaign of serb nationalism . </s><s> the countryside in central kosovo has been eerily silent since last thursday . </s><s> the sound of artillery thuds and mortar rounds have been noticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signified burning villages have vanished from the green hills and valleys . </s><s> police checkpoints are more relaxed and areas that were sealed off this time last week by the yugoslav army are now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors from the united states , european union and russia . </s><s> these monitors , many of whom are former military officers , have reported that the yugoslav army has `` stood down '' and that they have seen virtually no military action since late last week . </s><s> there has been sporadic shooting , the monitors have reported . </s><s> but this superficial calm is not good enough because the serb military has the capacity to resume fighting very quickly , a nato military officer said monday . </s><s> the officer added that a cease-fire in kosovo is `` pretty much enacted . '' </s><s> he also said that the `` trend toward compliance is positive . '' </s><s> the interior ministry police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees who have fled have the confidence to return , the military officer said . </s><s> some interior ministry police officers had left the province , but not enough , he added . </s><s> on the question of how badly damaged the kla had been by the yugoslav army 's three-month offensive , the nato officer said , `` it 's a fair assessment that the kla is dismantled but not destroyed . '' </s><s> holbrooke 's first stop monday was brussels , where he met with the secretary-general of nato , javier solana . </s><s> on tuesday he plans to travel to pristina , the capital of kosovo , where he is scheduled to meet with the ethnic albanian leader ibrahim rugova to present the political proposal for the future status of kosovo . </s><s> he is expected back in belgrade on tuesday afternoon for another session with milosevic .	u.s. envoy tells milosevic to get out of kosovo or face nato attack	us envoy tells milosevic pull back military , let albanian refugees return .	american envoy personally tells milsevic he must pull back in kosovo	milosovic must return military forces to bases to avoid nato attack .

generation mentally  loss soviet trade cause	fact north korean famine  generation lose  health system break	more than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in north korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired , a new study by international aid groups has found . </s><s> the study , the first scientific nutritional survey in north korea , confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers , who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country . </s><s> among other shocking findings , researchers from the world food program , unicef and the european union found that , because of long-term food shortages , a staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted growth . </s><s> they have discovered that , despite a huge international food aid program over the past three years , severe malnutrition is widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development , suggesting that this generation 's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that the losses can never be recovered . </s><s> separately , international medical workers from groups like the red cross , have begun to document how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health services . </s><s> even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine , red cross workers say , leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have . </s><s> as the north korean dictatorship has slowly , often grudgingly , granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six months , an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies . </s><s> past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of north korean refugees who had fled into china . </s><s> and while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in north korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing : a population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger , people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal , the future of a generation irretrievably lost . </s><s> `` now at last we have hard facts _ the situation is very grave , '' said judith cheng-hopkins , regional director for asia of the world food program , which has taken part in the research . </s><s> `` to me this is a famine in slow motion . </s><s> people cope year after year , and probably a lot drop off . </s><s> but the totality is very hard to gauge . '' </s><s> for three weeks this fall , crews led by foreign scientists were finally permitted to fan out across north korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children , providing by far the most solid data on the crisis . </s><s> they found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth , a symptom of long-term malnutrition . </s><s> thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition . </s><s> this means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development , because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year . </s><s> the researchers said that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago , malnutrition was rare in north korea . </s><s> `` even if the situation improves , it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw , '' said judit katona-apte , a senior program adviser for the world food program . </s><s> `` people will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities . '' </s><s> likewise , when red cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate , they found that not one had water that was suitable for human consumption , said sten swedlund , head of the red cross delegation in north korea . </s><s> `` but of course they drink it _ they have no choice , '' he said during a recent trip to beijing . </s><s> `` there is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that 's in very bad shape . '' </s><s> virtually all the children under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea , he said . </s><s> none of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths , and the north koreans have not released relevant figures , although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began . </s><s> but public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case , because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation , but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger , so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal . </s><s> still , there are some disturbing clues : in one limited study conducted by the world food program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked by the government , 10 percent had a parent who was dead . </s><s> in this fall 's independent nutritional survey , 18 teams of experts sent to eight of north korea 's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children under seven . </s><s> in addition to finding that 62 percent of children had stunted growth , the teams found that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height , a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study . </s><s> that figure is higher than in any country in east asia and puts north korea among the world 's worst 10 countries in terms of malnutrition . </s><s> while that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as that of india and bangladesh , the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate , experts say that north korea 's number in some ways understates the problem . </s><s> in india and bangladesh , pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty , while in north korea the whole country is to some degree underfed . </s><s> `` even in war-torn countries , famine is more in pockets , '' dr. katona-apte said . </s><s> `` it 's hard to think of another country that 's been affected in this way . '' </s><s> the survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied only children under 7 , the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad . </s><s> after three years of food donations , many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings are failing . </s><s> so a month ago , the world food program began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged 7 to 12 . </s><s> `` we have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker , '' swedlund said . </s><s> there are now more than 100 westerners living in pyongyang , the capital city , and many say the long-term hunger is readily apparent there . </s><s> `` if you walk down the street in pyongyang and ask a child how old she is , you are usually off by three years , '' swedlund said . </s><s> `` she may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4 . '' </s><s> dr. katona-apte , a nutrition expert who has worked in bangladesh and the sudan , said she was shocked when she first visited a north korean kindergarten last year . </s><s> `` there were these two children sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin and they had patchy hair , '' she said . </s><s> `` and they were just sitting there working . </s><s> this is accepted as normal ! </s><s> they are in school , and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation . </s><s> if you saw them in a refugee camp , you would recommend immediate intervention . '' </s><s> but with a severely depleted public health and hospital system , that option does not exist , she and others said . </s><s> many korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition ; few had seen it before this decade . </s><s> and , in any case , the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements . </s><s> swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines , had no glass to replace broken windows and were `` colder inside than out , '' having received no coal since 1994 . </s><s> he said that even in hospitals , sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent , because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps . </s><s> he said that next year , the red cross would start to address those problems , spending $ 3.5 on food for hospital patients and $ 1 million on water treatment . </s><s> with few other options , vast numbers of north koreans have resorted to eating `` substitute food , '' hard cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants , like soybeans and sweet potatoes , combined with indigestible filler , like cornstalks and straw . </s><s> `` this now constitutes 40 percent of food intake , '' swedlund said . </s><s> `` it 's becoming a regular part of the food basket . '' </s><s> doctors in north korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating this partly indigestible material , he said , but added , `` if you 're very hungry , it fills your stomach . '' </s><s> although the north koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990 's , the foreign researchers who have worked in north korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the soviet union , which had long been north korea 's main supplier of food , fuel and fertilizer . </s><s> north korea is a mountainous country , with less than 20 percent arable land . </s><s> it has been a food importer for decades , mostly from the former soviet union , but also from china . </s><s> `` the country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and ca n't just be blamed on the weather anymore , '' ms. cheng-hopkins said . </s><s> still , she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening its restrictions . </s><s> swedlund said that after three years in the country , the international red cross , which collaborates with the north korean red cross , had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems . </s><s> travel is still restricted . </s><s> there are more than 100 counties , home to 30 percent of the population , to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies . </s><s> still , the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily , and freedom to move about has improved . </s><s> ms. cheng-hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections were now unannounced , and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at random . </s><s> workers from the red cross and the world food program said they had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently . </s><s> `` i have not seen acute starvation like i have seen in bangladesh , '' dr. katona-apte said . </s><s> `` but that does n't mean it ca n't exist . </s><s> we 're still really limited in what we can see .

minority  money key	the presidential campaign of 2000 began wednesday , like it or not . </s><s> the millennial election will be fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines , if not its exact boundaries , were drawn by the voters in tuesday 's elections , which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing democrats . </s><s> president clinton called it an `` astonishing '' triumph of issues over investigations and said the democrats had won so many major victories `` because they had a clear message . '' </s><s> republicans agreed . </s><s> of course the next 18 months will bring many surprises and many reversals of fortune . </s><s> but the election results offered important guidelines . </s><s> tuesday was a great day for vice president al gore , for at least three reasons . </s><s> he worked furiously and successfully in the last ten days before the balloting to persuade democratic loyalists not to stay home and sulk , appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224 candidates , according to his office . </s><s> a moderate within the spectrum of his own party , he watched moderates win crucial elections , notably in the california gubernatorial race , where lt. gov . </s><s> gray davis , a cautious pragmatist like gore , won a smashing victory . </s><s> the returns _ an even break in the senate and a democratic gain of five in the house of representatives _ also made the impeachment of president clinton less likely . </s><s> and the better shape clinton is in as his term ends , the better chance gore , his sidekick for six years now , stands in the presidential nomination process and , ultimately , the election . </s><s> but california voters also complicated the nominating process and set gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it , because he and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential aspirations . </s><s> in a referendum in 1996 , california adopted a primary system under which republicans , democrats and independent voters would all receive the same ballot , with candidates of all parties listed . </s><s> that violates the rules of both major parties , and a measure on the ballot tuesday , proposition 3 , would have rescinded the 1996 change . </s><s> but it failed , raising the possibility that california 's march 7 primary will be a mere political popularity poll , with convention delegates chosen in caucus or convention _ a nightmare . </s><s> tuesday was a bad day for the republican right . </s><s> high-profile right-wingers lost across the country , from attorney general dan lungren in the california governor 's race to sen. lauch faircloth , denied re-election in north carolina , to rep. mark neumann of wisconsin , who failed in a senate race despite a huge spending advantage over sen. russell feingold , to ellen sauerbrey in maryland , who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an unpopular democratic governor , parris glendening . </s><s> both conservatives and moderates in the party said the republicans had to get back to basics . </s><s> even speaker newt gingrich conceded that the results `` should sober every republican '' and called for new strategic thinking . </s><s> `` if you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent approval rating , as they tried to do , you should n't be surprised if the election goes against you , '' said gov . </s><s> tom ridge of pennsylvania , a moderate whose promoters mention him weekly as a possible vice-presidential nominee . </s><s> sen. john mccain of arizona , a conservative who tends to steer away from divisive social issues , won re-election with 68 per cent of the vote . </s><s> he is studying the possibility of a presidential race , but before he or any other republican nominee can hope to win , he said in an interview wednesday , congressional republicans and their leaders need to learn some lessons . </s><s> `` i just hope this debacle is a wake-up call for our people , '' he said . </s><s> `` you 've got to be for something _ smaller government , better education , something . </s><s> we 're seen as the party that 's against everything . '' </s><s> polls taken late in this year 's campaign bore mccain out . </s><s> they showed that the republicans are no longer identified with issues that were once their electoral bread and butter , such as low taxes and law and order . </s><s> tuesday was also a fresh demonstration , for anyone who needed one , of the political utility of pitching a tent big enough for almost everyone . </s><s> black politicians in north carolina , maryland and california reported that their fears of an indifferent black turnout had proved groundless . </s><s> black votes proved indispensable to a considerable number of hard-pressed democratic candidates , especially where they felt their interests directly threatened . </s><s> the figures on hispanic voting , assembled from exit polls and from the candidates ' own precinct analyses , showed dramatic differences . </s><s> in california , where the outgoing republican governor , pete wilson , had played the anti-immigration card with a vengeance , both major democratic candidates _ davis and sen. barbara boxer , who won re-election after trailing in early polls _ cleaned up among hispanic voters . </s><s> he took 78 percent , she 72 . </s><s> but both of the bush brothers , jeb in florida and george w. in texas , took more than half the hispanic vote in their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns . </s><s> so did mccain . </s><s> jeb bush is married to a hispanic woman , he and his brother both speak spanish fluently and frequently , and senator mccain has long espoused hispanic causes . </s><s> both george w. bush and mccain will draw strength , if they decide to run , from their proven ability to appeal to hispanic voters , as well as their general electoral strength . </s><s> george w. bush took 69 percent of the vote in texas , where a democrat sat in the governor 's chair only four years ago , and which has the second-largest bloc of electoral votes . </s><s> florida has the fourth-largest . </s><s> governor bush of texas uttered a rallying cry for the moderates . </s><s> `` a leader who is compassionate and conservative , '' he said in his victory speech , `` can erase the gender gap and open the republican party to new faces and new voices . '' </s><s> but figures on the right saw things differently . </s><s> james dobson , a leading religious broadcaster , said that republicans had fared poorly because gingrich and sen. trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , had caved in to the president on the budget and de-emphasized social issues such as abortion and flag desecration . </s><s> he called all but explicitly for the ouster of gingrich . </s><s> likewise , the millionaire publisher steve forbes , another probable candidate in 2000 , said the leadership `` will have a lot to answer for . '' </s><s> tuesday proved the potency of education as an issue , and suggested that it will emerge as a major theme of the 2000 campaign . </s><s> clinton , in his limited involvement in the campaign , and gore , in his extensive participation , both stressed democratic programs to build more schools and hire more teachers . </s><s> almost a quarter of california voters _ and there are now almost twice as many voters in california as in any other state _ named education as their most pressing concern . </s><s> elsewhere , democrats won the governorships of alabama and south carolina against the odds , partly by emphasizing their rivals ' opposition to lotteries that will help to pay for schools . </s><s> in iowa , a democrat was elected governor for the first time since 1969 on a platform that featured the dilapidated condition of the state 's schools and a promise to remedy it . </s><s> tuesday demonstrated the overriding importance of money in modern american politics . </s><s> feingold , one of the principal backers of campaign-finance reform , survived to fight another day , but so did opponents of reform . </s><s> and the returns in house races , showing that all but six of 401 members who sought re-election had won , underlined once again how hard it is , under the present system , for a challenger to raise enough money to compete effectively . </s><s> the difficulties of raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies . </s><s> gore will have what he needs , as will bush , forbes and former gov . </s><s> lamar alexander of tennessee . </s><s> but how many others will ? </s><s> finally , tuesday delivered an indecisive message about impeachment . </s><s> close to two-thirds of voters nationwide told exit pollsters that they intended to send no message about clinton , but they made it clear in response to other questions that they disliked the house inquiry into the president 's alleged misdeeds and wanted to see it end . </s><s> in only two states , kansas and nebraska , did a majority of voters say they favored even a congressional censure of clinton , a much milder form of punishment advocated by many clinton backers . </s><s> some republicans said privately that there should be no hearings at all in the clinton matter , and some democrats began talking about a deal , the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the matter to an early close . </s><s> nevertheless , republican members of the house judiciary committee said they needed to press ahead with the constitutional process that the house has set in motion . </s><s> among those taking that view were rep. bob barr of georgia , a fierce foe of the president , and rep. mary bono of california , whose tone has been more muted . </s><s> but rep. david dreier of california , the incoming rules committee chairman , said that `` the election has played a role in ensuring that one of us has a desire to drag that out . ''	1998 election results set stage for 2000 presidential campaign	election results hearten democrats as high-profile right-wingers lose	congressional , gubernatorial election results sobering for republicans	election : gore , moderates up ; far right , gop down ; minorities , money key .

gingrich grows	republican stun election result focus impeachment inquiry	election impact gop  impeachment plan  congressional leader	stunned by the democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections , congressional republicans tore into each other wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election . </s><s> the soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results showed that republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the senate and that democrats had picked up five seats in the house . </s><s> the democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president 's party had gained seats in a midterm election , and it whittled the republican house majority down to a mere six votes . </s><s> the democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political year marked by the months-long scandal over president clinton 's affair with monica lewinsky . </s><s> the republicans ' new 223-211 majority ( assuming a democrat leading in oregon holds on to win ) , with one independent , amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the republican-controlled congress of 1953 , the last time republicans controlled the house until they captured it again in 1994 . </s><s> with attention now shifting to the house judiciary committee and its impeachment inquiry , rep. henry hyde told fellow republicans on the panel in a conference call wednesday that the only witness republicans were likely to call would be the independent counsel , kenneth starr . </s><s> hyde , the chairman , told lawmakers he hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment by thanksgiving , an act that would take the issue out of his hands and put it into gingrich 's . </s><s> committee democrats declined comment wednesday until they could discuss hyde 's plan among themselves . </s><s> trying to put the best face on the results , speaker newt gingrich said in marietta , ga. , that the republicans still held onto the house for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932 . </s><s> but furious rank and file republicans burned up the phone lines to each other , discussing whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks . </s><s> `` we 've got to reach out and have more than southern white males running the washington republican party , '' said rep. joe scarborough , a conservative from florida . </s><s> he said that republicans this year had been left without any accomplishments to run on . </s><s> `` we need an agenda first of all , '' he said . </s><s> `` we went an entire calendar year without an agenda . '' </s><s> rep. chris shays , a moderate from connecticut called the election a devastating loss and said simply , `` there are going to be major changes in our leadership . </s><s> all segments of our party want to see change . '' </s><s> at the white house , clinton called the election results a vindication of his party 's policies . </s><s> `` if you look at all the results , '' he said , `` they are clear and unambiguous . </s><s> the american people want their business , their concerns , their children , their families , their future addressed here . </s><s> that 's what the messag e of the election was . '' </s><s> one of the first difficult questions now facing congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to removing clinton from office , and with a republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes required for impeachment can not be assembled . </s><s> in a public statement released wednesday , hyde said `` the committee continues to have a clear constituional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner . </s><s> our duty has not changed becasue the constitution has not changed . '' </s><s> but sen. robert torricelli , d-n.j. , said the election results guaranteed that impeachment will fail . </s><s> `` i think any serious effort to remove president clinton from office is effectively over , '' he said . </s><s> `` it is simply for newt gingrich and trent lott to decide on an exit strategy . '' </s><s> from the other side of the aisle , rep. rick lazio , a long island republican , said , `` the inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously , fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future . '' </s><s> for the past year , republicans struggled to keep control of the house with a 228-207 majority and to find consensus among their party 's competing factions . </s><s> with their numbers reduced , the republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that wants a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center . </s><s> any small republican faction will now have enormous leverage . </s><s> the new arithmetic of the house may even lead to democrats ' and moderate republicans ' forming ad hoc majorities on issues , taking control away from republican leaders . </s><s> already seeing some of the possibilities , rep. peter king of long island , n.y. , said northeastern republicans would be strengthened . </s><s> `` it gives us much more leverage with the leadership and makes it easier to protect new york , '' he said . </s><s> `` it 's going to weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast conservatives . '' </s><s> just two weeks ago , gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40 . </s><s> seeming uncharacteristically uncertain wednesday , he said he had trouble accounting for the results . </s><s> `` things were happening out there that none of us fully understand -- neither party in my judgment , '' he said . </s><s> taking his share of the blame for his party 's losses , the georgia republican said he had misjudged how the public would recoil from the clinton scandal as amplified in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other republican themes . </s><s> `` i mean i totally underestimated the degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition , '' he said . </s><s> `` and as a result i think we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting taxes and saving social security , winning the war on drugs , reforming education and national defense . '' </s><s> majority leader sen. trent lott of mississippi also admitted mistakes , saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final 96 hours of the campaign . </s><s> he also conceded that congress ' final scramble to pass a $ 500 billion budget bill hurt his party . </s><s> `` one of this lessons for republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation , '' he said in washington . </s><s> both lott and gingrich said republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax-cutting and shoring up the social security system . </s><s> even as the two leaders spoke , their angry rank-and-file lawmakers were making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount challenges against the republican leaders who have steered the congress since the republican 's assumed control four years ago . </s><s> one senior republican staffer said the house had become a `` tinderbox '' of intrigue . </s><s> scarborough said , `` the long distance charges in washington offices probably are going through the roof today . </s><s> everybody 's calling everybody . </s><s> everybody recognizes that something 's terribly wrong with the direction of washington republicans when republican governors are doing so well in new york , massachusetts , florida and texas . '' </s><s> and while gingrich has not gone out of his way to identify himself with the republican campaign 's last-minute ad blitz attacking president clinton , his caucus knows he is responsible . </s><s> gingrich has faced down an uprising before , foiling a coup attempt against him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his own leadership team in the summer of 1997 . </s><s> any move to remove him remains a long-shot . </s><s> but with house leadership elections now set for mid-november , republicans said this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological lines to moderates like shays as well . </s><s> `` we got shellacked , '' said rep. christopher cannon , a conserative from utah . </s><s> `` we beat ourselves because we had no agenda . '' </s><s> republicans were discussing possible challenges to gingrich , his second-in-command , rep. dick armey , and other members of the senior leadership team . </s><s> some were envisioning trying to run an entire new ticket headed by rep. bob livingston , the appropriations committee chairman from louisiana and including rep. steve largent , an oklahoma conservative . </s><s> asked whether tuesday 's election results could cost him the speakership , gingrich said , `` i 'm not particularly concerned . '' </s><s> republicans close to him said they expected the anger to dissipate . </s><s> in the senate , where leadership races take place in early december , some republicans were talking of mounting challenges against mid-level leadership figures . </s><s> several senators expressed particular pique toward the re-election chairman , senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , who poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying to defeat the democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul , russell feingold of wisconsin . </s><s> feingold won in a close race . </s><s> some lawmakers on wednesday approached sen. chuck hagel of nebraska to see if he would replace mcconnell . </s><s> hagel confirmed he had talked to more than eight senators , and was considering whether to challenge mcconnell . </s><s> hagel lambasted the republican leadership for the election outcome . </s><s> `` this is a big loss for us , '' he said . </s><s> `` we squandered a very historic opportunity last night . </s><s> to just break even is a loss . '' </s><s> most incumbents coasted to victory tuesday night . </s><s> but some will not be returning . </s><s> five house republicans were defeated : vince snowbarger of kansas , bill redmond of new mexico , jon fox of pennsylvania , mike pappas of new jersey , and rick white of washington . </s><s> one democrat also lost his re-election bid _ rep. jay johnson of wisconsin . </s><s> the new house members include 17 republicans and at least 22 democrats . </s><s> david wu , a democrat was leading molly bordonaro , a republican in the race for one house seat in oregon , but the final victory announcement was not expected until friday after absentee ballots are counted . </s><s> unlike the self-proclaimed `` revolutionaries '' of the republican class of 1994 , many of the newly elected members are career politicians who rose through the ranks of local and state government . </s><s> three of the democrats are the sons of former lawmakers , mark udall of colorado , son of morris udall who represented arizona ; tom udall of new mexico , son of the other udall brother , stewart , a former congressman and secretary of the interior , and charlie gonzalez , who o won the texas seat of his father , henry .	republican qualms over their leadership overshadow impeachment inquiry	republicans stunned at mid-term election loss , anger against gingrich grows	republicans stunned by election results now focus on impeachment inquiry	election and its impact on gop , impeachment plans , congressional leaders

millennium . </s><s> seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned it into a pumped-up , issue-driven house majority . </s><s> with a promise to balance the budget , end welfare and represent more conservative social values , he appeared to have rearranged the political map for congress just as ronald reagan had done for the presidency . </s><s> but gingrich 's leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the speaker 's office , he is in danger of marginalization . </s><s> a change this dramatic suggests something far more profound than a miscalculation about election tactics . </s><s> what looked like one of the major realignments in u.s. political history might turn out to have been nothing but a temporary shift . </s><s> the gingrich revolution was fueled by anger , a revolt of white working-class americans against what they perceived as a democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities , and a middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big deficits . </s><s> they were the same resentments that ronald reagan had exploited so successfully . </s><s> but old political habits and a moribund republican leadership allowed the democrats to retain control of congress throughout the 1980s , and turned reagan 's economic program into an undisciplined tax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gaps . </s><s> gingrich 's attention-grabbing rhetoric , energy and talent for political organization finally took reagan 's formula for success to the congressional elections in 1994 . </s><s> but once in power , he ran head on into bill clinton , whose political instincts were even better . </s><s> the president co-opted parts of the contract with america , particularly the balanced budget and welfare reform . </s><s> he adapted the republican social message into a call for things like school uniforms and television rating systems , which symbolized more responsibility and parental control without supporting government intrusion into private lives . </s><s> the republican right 's genuine contempt for clinton was based in part on the well-known flaws in the president 's character . </s><s> but it was mainly a reaction to the ease with which he had diverted what was supposed to be the flood tide of their revolution . </s><s> they expected that the genuine successes of gingrich 's first year in office would lead to still larger victories for minimal government and taxes , unfettered free enterprise and a return to conservative christian values . </s><s> but the public was happy to be led in another direction , and focus on the concerns of aging baby boomers about health care and social security . </s><s> the government that was seen as the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again looked like a potential ally . </s><s> back in 1994 , both parties were so stunned by the sudden change in their congressional fortunes that they may have overestimated what it all meant . </s><s> in particular they may not have realized how quickly good economic times , a drop in crime and national welfare reform could blunt the power of race in u.s. politics . </s><s> the democrats had become literally a minority party as white voters resentfully identified their policies with cities , blacks and immigrants . </s><s> but last week union workers and catholics returned to the democratic fold . </s><s> without race as a wedge issue , the solid black democratic vote became a powerful advantage in key states . </s><s> blacks , women and

gingrich , who orchestrated the republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into president clinton , was driven from office friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in tuesday 's midterm elections . </s><s> catching virtually everyone on capitol hill by surprise , gingrich announced friday night in two conference calls to other republicans that he would not seek re-election as speaker in the nov. 18 vote and would leave congress altogether when his term expires in january . </s><s> `` this will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is in the system , '' gingrich said , according to a party aide who listened to one of the calls . </s><s> gingrich 's resignation was a stunning reversal for one of the most combative and personally confrontational politicians in america . </s><s> he made his name a decade ago by bringing down one democratic speaker , jim wright , and continued his assaultive style through tuesday 's elections with last-minute commercials reminding voters of the clinton scandal . </s><s> his reflexive pugilistic response was evident even friday night . </s><s> in his second conference call , according to several people who listened , gingrich blamed house conservatives for his downfall . </s><s> although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take control of congress in 1994 , they have become his most bitter critics in the last two years of his tumultuous speakership . </s><s> friday night he called them cannibals who had `` blackmailed '' him into quitting . </s><s> rep. michael p. forbes , r-n.y. , said : `` newt said all those who had marginalized the republican party had engaged in cannibalism . </s><s> he said , `refer to the clips . ' </s><s> he 's blaming others . '' </s><s> another republican described the conference call this way : `` he started off very statesmanlike , but then you could see the anger building . </s><s> when someone asked him why he was leaving , he said , `a handful of members have blackmailed the conference . ' </s><s> he said , `they 're hateful . ' </s><s> and he said , `they 're cannibals . '' ' </s><s> gingrich announced his move just hours after rep. robert l. livingston of louisiana announced he was running for speaker , putting himself forward as a pragmatist and a manager . </s><s> after the gingrich calls , rep. bill archer of texas announced he was considering his own run for speaker . </s><s> livingston and archer are chairmen of the two most powerful committees in the house . </s><s> in a statement gingrich said , `` the republican conference needs to be unified , and it is time for me to move forward . '' </s><s> he said he hoped his colleagues would pick a successor `` who can both reconcile and discipline , who can work together and communicate effectively . '' </s><s> referring to his wife , he told his colleagues he was resigning from congress because `` marianne and i are tired . </s><s> we need time off to get to know each other again . '' </s><s> he also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative attention to himself and his party . </s><s> `` if i stay , '' he told his colleagues friday night , `` my controversial nature would overshadow any successes we might have , '' an understatement to those who recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown of the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the back of air force one on a trip with president clinton . </s><s> according to another republican who took notes , gingrich said of his resignation : `` there is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members . </s><s> so long as i am around , i will always be a target in the news media , which would mean we would never be able to get our message out . '' </s><s> clinton said : `` newt gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the republican party to a majority in the house and joining me in a great national debate over how best to prepare america for the 21st century . </s><s> despite our profound differences , i appreciate those times we were able to work together in the national interest , especially speaker gingrich 's strong support for america 's continuing leadership for freedom , peace and prosperity in the world . '' </s><s> many republicans took the opportunity to portray gingrich as a visionary . </s><s> rep. sherwood boehlert of new york said that during the first conference call , `` there was shock and surprise and strong expressions of appreciation for leading us to the promised land . '' </s><s> his supporters said gingrich had the votes to win the election to nominate a speaker , which is to be conducted by secret ballot . </s><s> but , they agreed , the party 's slim , six-vote majority meant every vote would be a battle . </s><s> kenneth duberstein , a former official in the reagan administration , said , `` i have no doubt he had the votes to be speaker , but i 'm not sure he had the votes to govern . '' </s><s> he said that because of the deep rifts in the party , gingrich would not have been able to implement his plans . </s><s> in an unusually biting reaction , rep. dick gephardt of missouri , the democratic leader , said he hoped that gingrich 's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had fostered . </s><s> `` i hope that whoever succeeds newt gingrich as speaker will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was wrought on this institution over the last four years , '' gephardt said . </s><s> house republicans predicted that gingrich 's resignation would set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than had been anticipated . </s><s> `` there will be a lot of pretenders to the throne who will test the waters , '' said boehlert , who had supported gingrich for re-election as speaker . </s><s> `` there wo n't be any shortage of candidates .

case	microsoft antitrust case  first major email trial	the outcome of the microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off , but one thing is already clear : this is the first major e-mail trial . </s><s> the government 's prosecution and microsoft corp. 's defense , to a striking degree , are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages . </s><s> the human testimony often pales next to the e-mail evidence . </s><s> on the stand or in videotaped testimony , the people being questioned shrug , mumble and forget . </s><s> the e-mail is alive with ideas and competitive zeal , punctuated with profanity and exclamation points . </s><s> the second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by microsoft 's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a videotaped deposition of bill gates , the microsoft chairman . </s><s> with a new witness , an executive of apple computer inc. , taking the stand monday , it is uncertain when the gates tape will be played . </s><s> the justice department and the 20 states suing microsoft believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows gates saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the internet software market . </s><s> the gates videotape , said david boies , the justice department 's trial lawyer , offers an `` opportunity to judge gates ' credibility . '' </s><s> but the gates credibility gap , if there is one , becomes an issue not because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be compared and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received . </s><s> the e-mail record , the government insists , shows gates waist-deep in plotting the anti-competitive deals and bullying tactics that he denies or professes to have never heard of in his taped deposition . </s><s> if his machinations are central to the government 's case , why not summon gates to the trial ? </s><s> `` the government does not need to put gates on the stand , because we have his e-mail and memoranda , '' stephen houck , a lawyer for the states , told the court . </s><s> the microsoft legal team has for months been preparing its e-mail defense . </s><s> first , microsoft argues , anything that looks damaging is taken out of context . </s><s> `` i urge your honor , '' john warden , microsoft 's lead lawyer , told judge thomas penfield jackson , `` to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the core of the government 's case . '' </s><s> but microsoft has also mounted an e-mail counterattack , culled from the millions of messages it obtained by subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery . </s><s> warden 's cross-examination ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a declaration as a question . </s><s> these interrogations have two refrains : is n't it true your company does exactly what you are accusing microsoft of doing , and is n't it true that microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist but because of its superior technology ? </s><s> microsoft is accused of trying to prod companies to stay out of its way . </s><s> so last week , for example , warden produced e-mail from stephen case , the chairman of america online , suggesting a partnership with netscape communications corp. in which both companies would focus on their respective strengths . </s><s> that division of labor , case wrote , would be the best way to achieve the goal that marc andreessen , netscape 's cofounder , described in an earlier e-mail as beating `` the beast from redmond that wants to see us both dead '' _ a reference to microsoft 's headquarters in redmond , wash. printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication . </s><s> by the 1920s , as typewriters became common , typed memoranda started to be used in court cases . </s><s> from the 1950s through the 1980s , legal experts say , there was an explosion of documentation fueled by the new technologies of electric typewriters , photocopying and fax machines , and then personal computers . </s><s> and e-mail , they add , has played an important role in legal inquiries for years , like the iran-contra case in the 1980s when e-mail found in oliver north 's computer proved crucial . </s><s> but the microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government antitrust investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail has supplanted the telephone as the most common instrument of communication . </s><s> `` e-mail has just revolutionized investigations of this kind , '' one senior justice department official said . </s><s> while under investigation , microsoft has handed over to the government an estimated 30 million documents , mostly e-mail . </s><s> in the trial , the two sides have submitted about 3,000 exhibits , mainly e-mail . </s><s> and in their e-mail , people often communicate more frankly and informally than when writing a letter or a report _ tap it out , punch a button and it 's gone into cyberspace . </s><s> but e-mail communication is documentary evidence , which in legal cases provides a rich , contemporaneous record of what people were thinking and planning at the time . </s><s> it can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony , so often coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory . </s><s> `` the e-mail record certainly makes the i-don't-recall line of response harder to sustain , '' said robert litan , a former senior official in the justice department 's antitrust division who is now at the brookings institution . </s><s> it can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions in testimony . </s><s> and that is what the government will do in attacking gates ' credibility with his videotaped deposition , taken over three days in august . </s><s> the government offered a glimpse of that strategy on the first day of the trial . </s><s> it showed a few brief clips of a point in the deposition when gates was asked about a meeting on june 21 , 1995 , at which , the government alleges , microsoft offered to divide the browser market with netscape and to make an investment in the company , which is its chief rival in that market . </s><s> in the taped deposition , gates says he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates whether he thought it made sense to invest in netscape . </s><s> he said that he was asked about it after the june 1995 meeting and replied , `` i did n't see that as something that made sense . '' </s><s> but in an e-mail on may 31 , 1995 , gates urged an alliance with netscape . </s><s> `` we could even pay them money as part of the deal , '' he wrote , `` buying a piece of them or something . '' </s><s> the contradiction between gates ' deposition and his e-mail , though , does not of itself speak to the issue of whether microsoft made an illegal offer to netscape . </s><s> to be sure , it is what microsoft did _ not what it said in e-mail communications _ that counts most . </s><s> `` but once the e-mail that looks bad gets in the record , you end up doing what microsoft 's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial doing _ trying to explain it away , '' said stephen axinn , a leading antitrust litigator with the firm axinn , veltrop & amp ; harkrider in new york .	microsoft trial e-mail reveals proposal for aol-netscape partnership	e-mail central to the prosecution of microsoft for anti-trust violations	huge volume of e-mail presented as evidence in microsoft antitrust case	microsoft antitrust case -- the first major e-mail trial

promising information-age fields where microsoft corp. is just another company _ the internet media business and electronic commerce . </s><s> with its proposed purchase of netscape communications corp. , aol , the nation 's largest dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscribers , hopes to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal . </s><s> if the $ 4 billion deal is completed _ the companies had not reached a final agreement as of monday night _ aol would acquire a leading internet brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing the millions who regularly visit netscape 's popular netcenter site on the world wide web . </s><s> `` acquiring netscape would really enhance america online 's role as the premier internet media company , '' said james f. moore , president of geopartners inc. , a consulting firm . </s><s> `` america online is assembling the kind of audience numbers that will convince people the internet is becoming a mainstream media . '' </s><s> in the new media business , as in traditional media like television or newspapers , eyeballs translate into advertising revenue . </s><s> but what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers about the new media _ news , entertainment and services rendered in computer code _ is that it is inherently a two-way medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mouse button the interaction that advertisers and marketers want to see , of course , is buying . </s><s> and it is the potential for exploiting an instant , direct connection to consumers that has fueled all the recent optimism about electronic commerce . </s><s> today , companies are selling everything from books to baby clothes over the internet . </s><s> most companies have not progressed beyond the experimentation stage , but there are a handful of encouraging success stories like amazon.com , the on-line bookstore . </s><s> by 2003 , forrester research inc. , whose business is analyzing trends in cyberspace , projects that internet commerce could reach $ 3.2 trillion , or 5 percent of all sales worldwide . </s><s> aol is at the forefront of this convergence of media and commerce converge , and integration reflected in the lineage of its leaders . </s><s> steve case , the chairman , was once a new-product manager for pepsico 's pizza hut chain , while robert pittman , the president , is a former mtv executive . </s><s> microsoft is also investing heavily in new media and electronic commerce . </s><s> it has an online service , msn , which competes with aol , as well as information-and commerce web sites that focus on travel , cars and real estate . </s><s> it also owns sidewalk , a network of local sites that list movies , restaurants and stores in cities around the country including seattle and new york . </s><s> its msnbc internet news service is half of a joint venture with nbc . </s><s> microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce business . </s><s> it has no shortage of bright people and it has more money than any rival . </s><s> besides deep pockets , microsoft has the built-in advantage in any computer-based medium because its windows operating system runs more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today . </s><s> its control of the windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age . </s><s> in theory , at least , owning that desktop screen should help microsoft steer consumers to its online offerings _ an issue that is key to the government 's antitrust suit against microsoft . </s><s> but so far , microsoft has started slowly in the fields of internet media and electronic commerce . </s><s> `` microsoft may want to , but it does not dominate these new markets , '' said richard shaffer , a principal of technologic partners , a research firm . </s><s> `` america online recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth businesses like electronic commerce instead of trying to take microsoft on head-on . '' </s><s> still , if the netscape deal is completed , aol will also find itself in the software business in a way it has never been in the past . </s><s> netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial development of software used to navigate the world wide web . </s><s> microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively , bundling its own browser with its windows and giving it away free _ tactics that have been challenged by the government . </s><s> but netscape no longer generates revenues from its browser , which it now also distributes for free , but from the sale of heavy-duty software sold to corporations . </s><s> much of this software is used as the technological `` back office '' for electronic commerce _ used in building web sites and processing transactions . </s><s> a surprising element in the proposed deal is that aol intends to hold onto netscape 's corporate software business instead of selling it off to an established software company . </s><s> `` america online just does n't have credibility in that market , '' observed michael a. cusumano , a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management . </s><s> executives close to aol explain the decision as the need to provide full-line offerings for electronic commerce , from corporate web site to the computer screens of consumers . </s><s> but aol has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen netscape 's corporate software business . </s><s> to do that , it has brought in sun microsystems inc. in a side deal , which has complicated the transaction considerably . </s><s> aol , according to executives close to the proposed deal , will own netscape , but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with sun . </s><s> as part of the deal , aol will agree to purchase about $ 300 million worth of sun 's computers for its service , while sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of netscape software , which sun 's sales force must sell . </s><s> still , aol and sun have a longer-term objective as well _ one that promises to place them in more direct conflict with microsoft . </s><s> for nearly a year , william j. raduchel , sun 's chief strategist , has been working closely with aol , according to sun executives . </s><s> a former harvard economics professor who taught scott mcnealy , the sun chairman , raduchel has focused on sun 's internet programming technologies , called java and jini , both of which are seen as potential threats to microsoft 's dominance . </s><s> by combining sun 's technology prowess with aol 's powerful consumer brand , the sun executives say , there is the potential for a kind end-run around microsoft 's grip on desktop computing . </s><s> in its research laboratories , sun has been working on a stripped-down network computer _ a simple-to-use information appliance , which could cost as little as $ 200 or be given away as part of a subscription service . </s><s> the concept is that aol 's internet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered to many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense and difficulty of using a personal computer . </s><s> the appliance would be mainly a receiver and screen , with most of the computing power residing on vast central computers serving up information as users request by tapping a few buttons . </s><s> sun 's technological specialty is this kind of centralized `` network '' computing . </s><s> if the long-term aol-sun vision ever materialized _ certainly a three-to-five year bet , at the least _ it could give both companies a boost and technological independence from microsoft .	aol-netscape-sun plan would give technological independence from microsoft	aol seeks to expand web domination with purchase of netscape	media business , electronic commerce , aol , netscape , sun , microsoft	electronic commerce , instant direct connection to consumers , aol , netscape

industry	microsoft corp. argued in federal court monday that the proposed acquisition of netscape communications corp. by america online seriously undermined the government 's antitrust suit against the software giant . </s><s> `` from a legal standpoint , this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the government , '' william neukom , microsoft 's senior vice president for legal affairs , said monday morning on the courthouse steps . </s><s> the reasoning behind this assertion , microsoft says , is that the proposed deal demonstrates that netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant _ even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive practices alleged in the government 's suit . </s><s> but david boies , the government 's lead attorney , said all of that was irrelevant . </s><s> `` whatever the deal ends up being _ if there ends up being a deal _ is not going to remove any of the obstacles that microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this industry , '' he said . </s><s> michael lacovara , a microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness , economist frederick warren-boulton , suggested to him during the trial monday that the proposed acquisition undermined warren-boulton 's argument , that microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems . </s><s> after all , about 22 percent of americans who use the internet reach it through america online . </s><s> and at present aol uses microsoft 's web browser , internet explorer , as the service 's default choice . </s><s> in exchange for that , microsoft places an aol advertisement and internet link in windows 98 . </s><s> lacovara asked the witness whether , once aol 's service contract expires in january , he would `` expect aol to continue to distribute microsoft software . '' </s><s> yes , warren-boulton responded . </s><s> `` it is not at all clear to me that aol 's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with netscape . '' </s><s> he noted that america online officials had said their need to be among the online services featured in windows forced them to accept microsoft terms _ establishing internet explorer as the default choice . </s><s> lacovara then asked warren-boulton the question that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and microsoft 's larger assertion monday about the proposed netscape-aol deal . </s><s> `` surely this combination , '' he asked , `` tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry ? '' </s><s> warren-boulton 's answer was probably not the one lacovara had been after . </s><s> `` to the extent that this potential merger is the result of microsoft 's actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions , '' he said , `` it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like netscape , the brightest , newest star . '' </s><s> warren-boulton 's purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system software ; more than 90 percent of the world 's computers use a microsoft operating system . </s><s> that is the foundation under most of the government 's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition . </s><s> through repeated , often circumlocutious questioning , lacovara tried to make the case that microsoft 's overwhelming market share was ephemeral . </s><s> the software industry is so vibrant and fast moving , he suggested , that microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment _ a point of view the company encourages among its employees . </s><s> on friday and monday , lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market , and some software companies _ principally microsoft 's greatest rivals _ are writing software for these new systems . </s><s> but warren-boulton argued that `` the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean in any way that microsoft does not have monopoly power . '' </s><s> on monday afternoon , lacovara made an issue of the success apple computer co. is having selling its new imac computer . </s><s> he entered into evidence an apple news release issued last month showing , among other things , that 12.5 percent of the people buying apple 's new imac computer had previously owned a windows machine . </s><s> apple computers use a different operating system , mac-os .	microsoft argues aol-netscape deal would undermine government 's case	microsoft says aol attempt to acquire netscape weakens anti-trust case	microsoft argues that company mergers weaken antitrust suit against it	microsoft says aol/netscape/sun deal demonstrates healthy software industry

world in which the world wide web is a limitless marketplace of information , entertainment , products and services , america online inc. tuesday laid out the details of its agreement to buy the netscape communications corporation for $ 4.2 billion . </s><s> by moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media , america online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giants like the microsoft corp. and the international business machines corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall . </s><s> part of that vision rests on an alliance with sun microsystems that america online negotiated as part of the deal . </s><s> sun not only brings a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort but , even more importantly , a strong technology partner in developing netscape 's industrial-strength software for running internet sites . </s><s> sun is indeed a technology heavyweight . </s><s> it owns the java programming language specially designed for internet applications , and solaris , among the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful computers that big corporations use to serve up internet services like the world wide web , e-mail and retail transactions . </s><s> it also manufactures a highly respected line of powerful computers based on its own microprocessor chips . </s><s> but for america online _ and for the big internet players against which it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies further down the road , perhaps five years away , when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive internet appliances costing $ 200 each , or maybe included free as part of a subscription service , just as some cellular phones are now . </s><s> today , being wired remains a comparatively elitist activity _ an estimated 25 percent of american households had access to the internet last year , and 5 percent of households bought merchandise on line . </s><s> but the executives at america online and netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the net is ubiquitous , when people will tap into the world wide web from appliance-like devices , pagers , cell phones , television set-top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone today . </s><s> `` a new generation of internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the long run , '' said stephen m. case , 40 , the chairman of america online . </s><s> for the present , however , the idea is to make america online , the nation 's leading online service , the standard way to get onto the internet , the executives explained . </s><s> netscape , the internet pioneer , is a crucial part of that effort , they said . </s><s> there is no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or , even if it does , that the america online-netscape combination will lead the way . </s><s> still , the long-range game plan helps explain what brought america online and netscape together . </s><s> and the ability of the companies ' executives to sell that vision to netscape 's whiz-kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds . </s><s> netscape 's headquarters in mountain view , calif. , is likely become a prime target for silicon valley headhunters . </s><s> as is the case with any software company , netscape 's key asset is its talented programmers , and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for america online , which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering to online newcomers , known derisively as `` newbies . '' </s><s> stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep netscape employees on board . </s><s> `` but these people want to change the world , and we 've got to be clear that joining with america online , along with the sun component , really is a bigger opportunity for us , '' said marc andreessen , the 26-year-old cofounder of netscape who led a team of young programmers from the supercomputing center at the university of illinois to silicon valley to start the internet software company in 1994 . </s><s> `` this ought to be the preeminent internet company over the next decade , '' andreessen declared , speaking from a cell phone on a streetcorner in palo alto , calif. for his part , andreessen , a netscape executive vice president , will become netscape 's chief technology officer for the next three or four months , until the merger is completed . </s><s> his new job at america online has not yet been determined , but it is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as well , an america online executive said . </s><s> already , according to one netscape board member , andreessen has delivered a 12-page single-spaced memorandum to case , setting out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future , emphasizing the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are linked to the internet . </s><s> netscape , populated with computing sophisticates , and america online , known as an on-ramp to the internet for the technologically challenged , seem a corporate odd couple . </s><s> but the two companies , its executives explained , had been evolving toward each other for more than a year . </s><s> in a telephone interview from america online 's headquarters in dulles , va. , case described netscape as an enterprise that had `` morphed itself '' from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the world wide web _ and `` in microsoft 's cross-hairs '' _ into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular netcenter web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce . </s><s> the netscape transformation was largely a reaction to microsoft 's competitive assault on its browser business _ a central element in the government 's antitrust suit against microsoft . </s><s> microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard windows operating system , and gave away the browser for free . </s><s> the government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices , while microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly to benefit consumers . </s><s> early this year , after laying off workers and suffering a large loss last year , netscape announced that it would also distribute its browser for free . </s><s> it seems to have stabilized its business around its new model . </s><s> netscape announced tuesday that it earned $ 2.7 million on revenues of $ 162 million in its fourth fiscal quarter , which ended in september . </s><s> yet america online has also changed in the last couple of years , moving well beyond its reputation as an online service for beginners . </s><s> it now has an internet chat service and runs its own all-in-one site on the web , known as a `` portal , '' which includes e-mail , internet searching , news , entertainment and online shopping . </s><s> `` america online has really changed from a closed online service for novice users to an internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands , '' andreessen said . </s><s> `` these two companies have been moving in the same direction , and the fit is a good one .

'' </s><s> analysts say the leader today in e-commerce services is ibm , which has a full line of offerings from sophisticated software products to hand-holding consulting . </s><s> other competitors include well-known information technology consulting companies such as andersen consulting , the spin-off from the arthur andersen accounting firm ; electronic data systems , which runs computer systems for big companies , and pricewaterhousecoopers , which offers accounting and consulting separately but under one umbrella . </s><s> software companies like microsoft and netscape sell packaged programs , typically with little or no consulting to help customers use them . </s><s> there are also plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic commerce services . </s><s> some , like agency.com and organic online , started basically as advertising and design firms . </s><s> others , including u s web and viant , have emphasized programming and consulting . </s><s> in fact , those two strains are blurring together , as exemplified by u s web 's pending merger with cks group . </s><s> america online argues that its advantage in this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about 15 million customers with netscape software , plus hardware from sun microsystems , which has joined in america online 's venture into electronic commerce engineering . </s><s> `` this is the first time anyone has put a true end-to-end solution that starts with the silicon and ends with the audience , '' said barry schuler , america online 's president for interactive services . </s><s> `` we start with sun 's line of servers , then the commerce tools to build a store , the support services to process orders and then a deal for online real estate that can drive the traffic . '' </s><s> despite the advantages netscape and sun bring , analysts say that america online faces a variety of problems in its new quest . </s><s> chief among them is whether it can appear to have the consistency , focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand . </s><s> `` aol is not the first company that comes to my mind when it comes to business-quality software , '' said robert chatham , a senior analyst with forrester research . </s><s> its decision to keep netscape as a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership with sun will not enhance its credibility , chatham said . </s><s> `` america online does n't look like a homogenous vendor , '' he added . </s><s> `` it looks like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of aol , netscape and sun . '' </s><s> nor have internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence , ms. gere of international data said , that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand . </s><s> `` telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships , '' she said . </s><s> pittman said that america online had been driven to the e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online . </s><s> `` we are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar stores are limited by their infrastructure , '' he said . </s><s> `` they have an online store , but their square footage is too small . '' </s><s> even before the netscape deal , america online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services . </s><s> it has been rewriting the software that lets companies open online stores to be based on universally accepted internet standards rather than the specific computer language used only on america online . </s><s> this new software , which now will be combined with netscape 's online store services , will be available for companies to use both on america online and on the internet . </s><s> similarly , it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make online purchases without retyping all that information each time . </s><s> america online is working to offer it _ for a fee _ to stores on the broader internet . </s><s> there is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic commerce . </s><s> these include high-end strategy consulting to help companies decide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional sale in stores . </s><s> there are all sorts of computer systems to be developed , ranging from the online stores themselves to connecting those sites to a company 's existing inventory and accounting systems . </s><s> there are creative services that include graphic design , media buying , customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts . </s><s> and there are operational services that involve actually maintaining the big servers that users connect to when they use the online stores that display catalogs , take orders and process payments . </s><s> america online , schuler said , will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather than back-office functions . </s><s> `` we will consult on how to merchandise and sell online , '' he said . </s><s> `` we understand the consumer piece of the puzzle . '' </s><s> some competitors worry that america online 's electronic commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware . </s><s> `` the challenge is to prove that clients are getting the best possible solution for their business , '' said robert gett , the chief executive of viant . </s><s> `` if they offer aol and netscape and sun , their answer is a bit tainted . '' </s><s> netscape does have an expanding force of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming . </s><s> but they have been most competitive , gett said , in competing for nuts-and-bolts projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out a full-fledged strategy on the web . </s><s> `` they say , `who knows our software better than netscape ? ' '' </s><s> gett said . </s><s> `` we help customers decide which platform is best for them . '' </s><s> but america online argues that the combined might of it , netscape and sun is just what the business needs . </s><s> `` we always believed that commerce , that is buying goods and services , is the huge revenue stream of the future , '' schuler said . </s><s> `` we have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg .

still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis . </s><s> `` i want to repeat once more _ there is no program , '' prime minister yevgeny primakov said . </s><s> `` it has yet to be worked out . '' </s><s> in most nations such a statement might provoke alarm . </s><s> but primakov was seeking to calm an anxious public that was worried that the kremlin 's cure could be worse than the disease . </s><s> it is not as if russians do not have something to be concerned about . </s><s> thursday primakov convened a meeting of top aides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic woes . </s><s> a main item on the agenda was the plan drafted by yuri maslyukov , a communist and the government 's senior policy maker on economic issues . </s><s> it did not take long for maslyukov 's plan to hit the street . </s><s> a newspaper , kommersant daily , published it in full thursday morning . </s><s> not surprisingly maslyukov 's plan calls for a greater state role in the economy , including controls on hard currency . </s><s> a new state bank for reconstruction and development would be established using the `` nationalized assets '' of failed commercial banks . </s><s> wages and pensions would be paid in two months , and the minimum wage would be indexed to inflation . </s><s> there would be huge tax cuts , a combination that suggested that the government was committed to printing additional money . </s><s> the exchange rate of the ruble would be set by the central bank , based on changes in inflation and the balance of payments . </s><s> maslyukov 's plan also implies that russians would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country . </s><s> it stipulates that hard currency could enter the country only with special authorization . </s><s> exporters would be required to sell most of their hard currency reserves . </s><s> that is an allusion to currency controls that sent shock waves through the russian public . </s><s> russians have come to treat the dollar as a second currency , and many people have squirreled away dollars as a hedge against inflation . </s><s> `` it is an obvious stupidity , '' otto latsis , a commentator with the newspaper noviye izvestiya , said . </s><s> `` people wo n't give their dollars away . </s><s> they will go to the black market if they need to . '' </s><s> yegor gaidar , the former prime minister who favors free markets , said the plan was a `` war against the dollar '' and predicted that it would lead to a shortage of imports . </s><s> as the criticism grew , primakov rushed to distance himself from the talk of currency controls . </s><s> `` the rumors of the state 's becoming a monopolist on the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense , '' he said , asserting that the document published by kommersant daily was just one of six possible plans . </s><s> primakov may be opposed to wildly unpopular currency controls . </s><s> he may be worried that the plan would would set off the panic buying of dollars , further depressing the ruble . </s><s> or he may simply be trying to keep his distance from maslyukov 's plan while russia tries to wrangle its next disbursement , $ 4.3 billion , from the international monetary fund . </s><s> the particulars could be modified , but many people following the maneuvering say they believe that it represents the basic thrust of the government 's thinking . </s><s> primakov has called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money supply , two themes of maslyukov 's plan . </s><s> the plan also has many similarities with the plan presented to the government by gorbachev-era advisers . </s><s> `` we think it is close to being a final document , '' said the united financial group , a russian investment business . </s><s> it is unclear how long primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy . </s><s> the ousted tax chief , boris fyodorov , has argued that the imf should not provide further aid until primakov has taken tough measures to build a free market . </s><s> primakov has , however , sought to turn that logic on its head , arguing that his government 's economic strategy will depend on the fund 's willingness to provide aid . </s><s> his aim appears to be to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund 's fault if russia is forced to default on its loans or take draconian measures at home . </s><s> or as primakov put it thursday , without the fund 's money , russia will have to impose `` unpopular measures .

's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last year in hong kong , they nervously congratulated each other for containing _ at least for the moment _ a nasty financial brush fire in asia . </s><s> in a year 's time , many predicted in hallway chatter , the troubles in thailand and indonesia would look like a replay of mexico in 1995 _ a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity . </s><s> talk about bad market calls . </s><s> twelve months later , as the same financial mandarins clog washington with their limousines and glide through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank , just about everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has : the worst downturn in japan since world war ii , economic meltdown in russia , a depression in indonesia that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line , and deep fears over what happens next in latin america . </s><s> what makes this year 's imf meeting most remarkable , though , is that the harshest criticisms are directed at the monetary fund itself , and , by extension , at the u.s. treasury , which is viewed as the power behind the imf . </s><s> this year , in place of confident predictions , there are mutual recriminations . </s><s> arguments are breaking out over whether the true culprits were crony capitalists and weakened leaders like russian president boris yeltsin , or huge investors who poured money into the world 's emerging markets with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s and panicked in the past twelve months . </s><s> whatever the reason , one reality prevails : hundreds of billions of dollars have fled from economies on four continents _ seeking the safest havens possible , often in the united states _ and the money is not returning anytime soon . </s><s> and the subtext of every seminar on capital flows and every conclave of nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt questions : can this be stopped ? </s><s> or is the world headed for a global recession ? </s><s> fifty-three years ago the imf was created after the bretton woods conference which sought to stabilize the world economy and secure the peace after world war ii . </s><s> now it is under attack from all sides , charged not only with worsening a bad situation by misjudging the economics , but with being politically tone-deaf in some of the most volatile capitals in the world , from jakarta , indonesia , to moscow . </s><s> for the first time , there are disturbing questions about whether the institution itself is still capable , financially or politically , of containing the kind of economic contagion that caught the world unaware . </s><s> once , the imf 's critics were largely found in africa and south asia , were the fund was often viewed as arrogant ; today they include wall street 's biggest players and top officials in the most powerful economies of asia and europe . </s><s> only a few _ including former secretary of state george schultz and members of congress who are increasingly suspicious of all international institutions _ are talking about scrapping the imf altogether . </s><s> but almost everyone is talking about creating a `` new financial architecture '' that can do what the old one clearly can not : smother financial wildfires before they leap around the globe . </s><s> president clinton , british prime minister tony blair and other leaders , after months of silence , have edged into the debate , in some cases wresting the issue for the first time from their finance ministers and central banks . </s><s> their fear , their advisers say , is that 15 months of financial turmoil are now threatening political stability . </s><s> such concerns have turned this year 's meeting into a tumbled mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions . </s><s> the japanese , the french , the southeast asians are all arriving in washington with different diagnoses of what went wrong , and different solutions about how to set it right . </s><s> the united states has its own set of plans , a mix of suggestions to force more disclosure of financial data in countries around the world and to impose more american-style financial standards and regulation . </s><s> meanwhile , an ideological argument is breaking out over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open markets _ a strategy pressed by the clinton administration for the past six years . </s><s> others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding the hospital while the patients are still on the operating tables . </s><s> `` last year the standard answer that all of us were given came down to this : `we have the imf and the world bank , and they know best , ' '' indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said over breakfast in washington the other day , reflecting on how the crisis turned 30 years of astounding growth in his country into an overnight depression . </s><s> `` then they said everything that went wrong was our fault , '' he said . </s><s> `` but now , now i think people know that much of the problem came from the outside , and we need something better . '' </s><s> and the imf itself is beginning to fight back , an awkward role for an institution dominated by ph.d. economists who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged . </s><s> `` every place you turn you read the same story , that we came in , that we made things worse , '' said stanley fischer , the deputy managing director of the fund , who was born in northern rhodesia _ now zambia _ and became chairman of the massachusetts institute of technology 's economics department before taking a job that has now put him in the center of the financial storm . </s><s> `` we frequently get the blame , some of it well-deserved , '' he said . </s><s> `` but it is politically convenient for governments around the world to cry , `the imf made us do it , ' and pin their mistakes on us . </s><s> that 's fine . </s><s> we 'd rather be loved , but more than that we 'd like to be effective . '' </s><s> miscalculations , politics and safety nets on a steaming january day , michel camdessus , the imf 's top official , slipped into jakarta to the private residence of president suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off , line by line , the huge reforms indonesia would have to implement in return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid . </s><s> two previous deals had collapsed when suharto ignored the fund 's conditions , so camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly with suharto , then asia 's longest-serving leader . </s><s> it was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power politics : suharto rose as a general in central java , and camdessus had detonated mines in algeria for the french army before entering the french treasury on his way to becoming head of france 's central bank . </s><s> `` it was all there , '' a senior imf official recalled . </s><s> `` he was told he had to dismantle the national airplane project , the clove monopoly , all the distribution monopolies . '' </s><s> at one point , camdessus looked at the impassive suharto and said , `` you see what this means for your family , '' a reference to their vast investments in the country 's key industries . </s><s> `` he said , `i called in my children , and they all understand . '' ' </s><s> but within months , that exchange in jakarta came to symbolize the imf 's twin troubles : its inability to understand and reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform , and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social costs of its actions . </s><s> suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement . </s><s> it was , one of his former cabinet members said , `` a delaying move that was obvious to everyone except camdessus . '' </s><s> perhaps one reason why the imf sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of ph.d. economists . </s><s> there are few officials with deep experience in international politics , much less the complexities of javanese culture that were at work in indonesia . </s><s> historically , experts in politics and security have gravitated to the united nations , development experts to the world bank , and economists to the imf _ creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one . </s><s> as a result , the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if its demands were met and all indonesia 's state monopolies were quickly dissolved . </s><s> while that system lined the pockets of the suhartos and their friends , it also distributed food , gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands . </s><s> to help balance the budget , the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low . </s><s> but that , combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked the crisis , resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots that continue to this day , as millions of indonesians lose their jobs . </s><s> the imf _ unintentionally , its officials insist _ also sped suharto 's resignation , insisting on the elimination of `` crony capitalism , '' code words for removing the suharto family from the center of the economy . </s><s> ultimately , that may prove to be indonesia 's salvation , if the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country 's fast-shrinking economy . </s><s> `` it is worth noting , '' fischer said this week , `` that our programs in asia _ in indonesia , korea and thailand _ only took hold after there was a change in government . '' </s><s> nonetheless , the indonesia experience has revived the argument that the imf is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies , on preventing capital flight and freeing up markets , that it is blind to the social costs of its actions . </s><s> among the toughest critics has been its sister institution , the world bank , whose main charge is alleviating poverty . </s><s> `` you 've seen the tension almost every day , '' one senior world bank official said recently . </s><s> the bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund , and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic chaos . </s><s> even u.n. secretary general kofi annan has joined the argument , warning in a speech at harvard recently that `` if globalization is to succeed , it must succeed for poor and rich alike . </s><s> it must deliver rights no less than riches . </s><s> it must be harnessed to the cause not of capital alone , but of development and prosperity for the poorest of the world . '' </s><s> imf officials say they are changing strategies when they see they are exacting too great a social cost . </s><s> `` it 's a very difficult formula to get exactly right , '' fischer said in august , as russia was teetering and the imf was sending in $ 4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted . </s><s> `` you need enough discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing . </s><s> but you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than they otherwise would . '' </s><s> in recent months , he noted , the imf has allowed more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in indonesia , korea and elsewhere . </s><s> `` there is a new flexibility at the imf '' a senior indonesian official concluded recently . </s><s> `` it is a lot better . '' </s><s> a u.s. pawn , or a runaway agency ? </s><s> the clinton administration admits that the imf has many failings , many of them on display this year . </s><s> but it insists that the world has gone through global financial crises without an imf once before in this century _ and the result was the 1930s . </s><s> `` i have no doubt the situation over the past year would have been much worse _ with greater devaluations , more defaults , more contagion , and greater trade dislocations _ without the program agreed with the imf and the finance it has provided , '' deputy treasury secretary lawrence summers told congress last week . </s><s> many republicans and some democrats are unconvinced . </s><s> even though the senate has overwhelmingly approved an $ 18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight new crises , the house defeated that measure two weeks ago . </s><s> the fund 's last hope of getting the money , which will free up nearly $ 100 billion in contributions from other nations waiting for the united states to act , will come when the house and senate try to resolve their budget differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days . </s><s> a rejection , treasury secretary robert rubin insists , would send a message around the world that the united states is turning its back on the one institution charged with restoring economic stability . </s><s> everywhere else in the world , though , politicians and businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the imf is that , contrary to the view of congress , it acts as the u.s. treasury 's lap dog . </s><s> ask in jakarta or moscow , and the response is the same : the imf never ventures far without looking back for the approving nod of its master . </s><s> when the united states weighs in , however , is when the imf is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble . </s><s> only then does the imf _ and the u.s. treasury _ have the leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid . </s><s> in theory , the u.s. influence is limited : it has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund . </s><s> germany , japan , france and britain have about 5 percent each . </s><s> but in practice the united states usually gets its way , exercising its influence behind the scenes , often in interactions between fischer and summers . </s><s> the two met when fischer was on the mit faculty and summers was a graduate student taking one of his classes , later becoming a colleague at mit . </s><s> each served as chief economist of the world bank . </s><s> it was summers who was instrumental in placing fischer in the fund 's no . </s><s> 2 job , and these days they talk constantly . </s><s> `` it 's usually a warm relationship , '' fischer said this summer . </s><s> `` remember , this is a job where you can not turn to outsiders for advice _ you ca n't call the chief economist at a wall street firm , or even many of your academic friends , because so many of the issues are confidential . '' </s><s> the treasury 's relations with camdessus are often more strained as he plays the role of world diplomat , traveling the globe and trying to coax along political leaders . </s><s> the tensions were obvious from the start of the asia crisis . </s><s> the fund made little secret of its displeasure that the united states was not offering direct aid to thailand , a major u.s. ally , as a sign of support and confidence . </s><s> mindful of the backlash in congress when mexico was bailed out with u.s. money , that was the last thing the treasury planned to do . </s><s> summers , in turn , thought the fund was not forcing the thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture . </s><s> within the u.s. government there was other dissension : the state and defense departments felt the united states should do more for thailand , but backed off when the treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budgets . </s><s> there were other conflicts . </s><s> when japan used the last imf meeting to propose setting up a $ 100 billion `` asia fund '' _ one that would exclude the united states and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the imf does . </s><s> rubin called up camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the japanese proposal would undercut the imf 's authority . </s><s> `` we 've just had a dispute with michel , '' rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant . </s><s> one of them shot back : `` and it 's only 8 a.m. '' camdessus backed down at rubin 's insistence and walked away from money that asia could have used . </s><s> japan says it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend , this time for a $ 30 billion fund . </s><s> camdessus has also rankled u.s. officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts . </s><s> in june , with russia on its way to collapse , camdessus declared that `` contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining '' about the slow collapse of russia 's economy , `` this is not a crisis . </s><s> this is not a major development . '' </s><s> the bailouts of russia and south korea were prime examples of how washington muscles into the imf 's turf as soon as major u.s. strategic interests are involved . </s><s> last christmas , as south korea slipped within days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in december , it sent a secret envoy , kim kihwan , to work out a rescue package . </s><s> `` i did n't bother going to the imf , '' kim recalled recently . </s><s> `` i called summers ' office at the treasury from my home in seoul , flew to washington and went directly there . </s><s> i knew that was how this would get done . '' </s><s> within days the treasury dispatched david lipton , its most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts , who is leaving his post as undersecretary for international affairs this month , to shadow the imf staff 's negotiations with the government in seoul . </s><s> fischer was displeased . </s><s> `` to make a negotiation effective , it has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating , '' he said . </s><s> who lost russia ? </s><s> the pattern was repeated this summer , when the united states raced to put together a $ 17 billion package for russia . </s><s> the imf 's staff in moscow declared that russia needed no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in investors . </s><s> the americans and germans came to a different conclusion . </s><s> soon after , u.s. officials gathered in the white house situation room to consider what might happen to russia if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the imf to come up with emergency money . </s><s> so the fund began assembling a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for seven years . </s><s> camdessus , though , was still hesitant , questioning whether the imf should risk its scarce resources in russia . </s><s> `` we had to pull michel along , '' a senior treasury official recalled . </s><s> as it turned out , camdessus ' instincts were right while the approach championed by rubin and summers proved disastrously wrong . </s><s> the first installment of that payment _ $ 4.8 billion _ was wasted , propping up the currency long enough , in the words of one imf official , `` to let the oligarchs get their money out of the country . '' </s><s> then yeltsin reversed his commitments , let the ruble devalue anyway , began printing money with abandon and fired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a collapse of the imf agreements and the indefinite suspension of its aid program . </s><s> now , inside the imf and on capitol hill , there are recriminations over `` who lost russia . '' </s><s> publicly , fischer argues that `` there are no apologies owed for what we attempted in russia . '' </s><s> but some imf officials complain privately that they let rubin and summers run roughshod over them , striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the russian parliament rebelled and yeltsin backed away from his commitments . </s><s> summers responds that the united states `` took a calculated risk '' because `` it was vastly better that russia succeed than not succeed . '' </s><s> the russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion , with investors fleeing latin america , and triggering huge losses in hedge funds like long term capital , the greenwich , conn. , investment firm that needed to be rescued by wall street powerhouses whose money it had invested . </s><s> `` russia was a turning point , '' said robert hormats , the vice chairman of goldman , sachs & amp ; co. `` it made the world realize that some countries can fail , even if the imf and the treasury intercede . </s><s> and that changed the perception of risk . '' </s><s> now , as the countries meet to face a future that the imf has warned could be very bleak , they need to reverse those perceptions , or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital . </s><s> the emerging markets are calling for controls on short term investments . </s><s> the french want a stronger imf . </s><s> the americans say the answer is more disclosure , so that investors are better warned , and tougher regulation . </s><s> `` these are usually nice , quiet meetings ; everyone very polite , '' a top u.s. official said earlier this week . </s><s> `` not this year .

longer wish good health to baba anya in omsk . </s><s> the post office is broke . </s><s> in 60 of the country 's 89 statelike regions , more than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked , many stuffed with up to 18 tons of letters , newspapers and parcels . </s><s> the state railway ministry refuses to carry more mail until the post office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $ 13 million in today 's dollars , or $ 35 million in dollars six weeks ago . </s><s> air mail , which amounts to one of every four or five letters , was also suspended at one of moscow 's major airports until this week , when the post office coughed up 5 million rubles for old bills . </s><s> a second airport is still demanding 3 million rubles for past-due debts . </s><s> so much mail is backed up that post offices in moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail , except for areas that can be easily reached by truck . </s><s> delivery schedules have fallen weeks , and perhaps months , behind . </s><s> `` the situation is really extraordinary , '' said vladimir sherekhov , the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government 's communications committee . </s><s> `` we 've never had anything like this before . '' </s><s> maybe the post office has been lucky . </s><s> extraordinary is the rule elsewhere in russia . </s><s> until friday , the lower house of parliament was preparing to sue the government for failure to provide soap , heat , toilet paper and copy-machine paper in the legislature 's monumental downtown offices . </s><s> it turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation 's economic crisis . </s><s> earlier in the week , officials said russia 's arctic shipping routes may close next month because half the nation 's icebreakers are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them . </s><s> the oldest of the ships is so ancient that its nickname is granny . </s><s> such anecdotal evidence that russia is losing its wheels , like one of its old , ill-maintained volga sedans , is everywhere . </s><s> but oddly , real signs of public distress are not particularly common , perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part as big as a postal system . </s><s> if the u.s . </s><s> postal service is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills , the russian post office still holds a special place in the national conversation . </s><s> russians still write letters to each other , frequently and fervently , and many in remote regions get their news through the mail . </s><s> millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas , an especially vital service in winter . </s><s> and in the last few years , the post office has become a vehicle for a growing mail-order trade in books , clothes and other catalog items not readily available outside big cities . </s><s> exactly why all this has rumbled to a halt is in some dispute . </s><s> what is clear is that the post office and the railway ministry both suffer from what ails every russian venture , private and public alike : nobody pays his bills . </s><s> the state railway ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not . </s><s> the government has specified nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing . </s><s> among the biggest deadbeats are the `` power ministries '' _ the military and interior departments _ which did not pay during soviet times and feel little need to pay now . </s><s> `` it 's a psychology formed during the socialist period , '' said tatiana pashkova , the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry , `` and the same situation exists with the post office . </s><s> we 've been in dispute for a very long time . </s><s> always we try to understand their differences . </s><s> but we ca n't carry cargo for free . '' </s><s> no kidding , says the post office : it , too , is owed 200 million rubles by government agencies , and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs are outstripping revenues . </s><s> moreover , the post office is also required by the government to carry some forms of mail , such as pension checks , at reduced rates . </s><s> officials at the state communications department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads ' actions : a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business . </s><s> `` here 's competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels , and i think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by this competition , '' sherekhov said . </s><s> `` they blame us for carrying some commercial cargoes instead of mail . '' </s><s> the railways ministry 's spokeswoman , ms. pashkova , said such `` commercial cargoes '' are indeed a problem , but only because the railroads know that the post office has already gotten cash to transport the packages . </s><s> the railroads are still waiting for their share of that money , she said . </s><s> in the meantime , the situation has come to a boil . </s><s> in late september the railroads cut mail service in and out of moscow , effectively decapitating the postal system and forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city . </s><s> hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for unloading has become difficult . </s><s> at last count , 39 loaded cars were awaiting service at one yard . </s><s> and customers are getting angry . </s><s> `` we 've gotten all kinds of complaints , '' said viktor salikov , a deputy in the communications department 's mail shipping center . </s><s> `` people are even coming to us , searching for mail that was sent weeks ago .

shuttle launch flawless  mission  attach us russian module	the planet 's most daring construction job began friday as the shuttle endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first u.s.-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $ 100 billion . </s><s> after a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early thursday , the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 friday morning , right on schedule . </s><s> the night sky was clear , and the moon full . </s><s> with a roar , endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned the florida coastline from night to day . </s><s> more than five minutes and 500 miles later , the spaceship 's main engines could still be seen in the distance , twinkling like a new star . </s><s> on their 12-day flight , endeavour 's astronauts are to locate a russian part already in orbit , grasp it with the shuttle 's robot arm and attach the new u.s. module . </s><s> wielding tools hundreds of miles above earth , working methodically in the cold void , the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly that is likely to make the construction of the pyramids and the great cathedrals look like child 's play . </s><s> construction of the station , which will be a research facility , will require an estimated 160 space walks , which , for safety reasons , will always be done by two people . </s><s> when complete , the international space station , dominated by solar power arrays , will cover an area equal to that of two football fields . </s><s> modules of interconnected laboratories and living quarters for up to seven astronauts are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners . </s><s> the station 's batteries alone , if lined up , would extend a half-mile . </s><s> the project entails high risk , because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space , along with the dangers inherent in flying the space shuttle to the construction site . </s><s> the work is further complicated by international politics and worries about money . </s><s> the russians , whose participation in the partnership clinched the post-cold war deal five years ago , are now a wild card . </s><s> moscow 's economic and political woes have left western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of money and technology . </s><s> at the same time , the station 's costs are rising , and its critics among scientists worry that its appetite for money will consume their own federal financing . </s><s> the project 's total cost is a subject of debate , but the most credible estimates now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade , the station 's estimated lifetime , at $ 110 billion . </s><s> of that , american taxpayers are to spend roughly $ 96 billion , and the project 's 15 foreign partners about $ 14 billion . </s><s> the station is intended to be a grand laboratory where , in the environment of weightlessness , investigators can develop new materials and new drugs and explore physiology 's remaining mysteries , in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space flight to other worlds . </s><s> friday , in any case , little was heard about the project but praise . </s><s> `` great show , endeavour , '' mission control in houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into orbit . </s><s> at the florida spaceport , secretary of state madeleine albright lauded the launching team and the new venture . </s><s> `` that was truly , truly fantastic , '' she told the team after the liftoff . </s><s> and it was important , she added , to have so many nations `` working together on the kinds of issues that the 21st century is going to be concerned with . '' </s><s> `` so my congratulations to all of you , '' the secretary said . </s><s> `` stupendous work . '' </s><s> the main cargo thursday was the unity module , the first u.s.-built station part . </s><s> small compared with the giants to come in three dozen shuttle flights during assembly , the unit is 18 feet long , weighs 13 tons and is to serve as a connecting hub for other modules . </s><s> saturday , one of the astronauts , lt. col. nancy currie of the army , is to have the shuttle 's robot arm hoist unity from the payload bay and secure it to endeavour 's docking system , moving the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position . </s><s> then , sunday , the astronauts are to rendezvous with the module known as zarya , or sunrise , which russia launched into orbit from kazakhstan on nov. 20 . </s><s> financed by the united states but built in russia , zarya , 41 feet long , is be a kind of tugboat for the embryonic station , furnishing power and propulsion as well as communication and rendezvous abilities . </s><s> when endeavour 's payload bay is within 10 feet of zarya , colonel currie is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the russian module into position over unity . </s><s> the mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big . </s><s> zarya , while completely weightless in space , has 21 tons of mass . </s><s> if mishandled , it can crush and kill . </s><s> as col. currie holds zarya steady , endeavour 's commander , col. robert cabana of the marine corps , a veteran of three space flights , is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station pieces together . </s><s> when mated with special attachments , zarya and unity will form the station 's first element , 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out to the tips of the solar arrays . </s><s> starting monday , a pair of space-walking astronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between the units , attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future visitors . </s><s> the builders will be col. jerry ross of the air force , 50 , and dr. james newman , 42 , a physicist . </s><s> their series of three space walks will continue wednesday and end saturday , dec. 12 . </s><s> as construction goes on outside , the astronauts inside endeavour will be busy making preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and docking system . </s><s> next thursday , the crew will enter the embryonic station for the first time , installing portable fans and lights . </s><s> friday they will again enter , to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major element , the first one both built and financed by russia . </s><s> the other astronauts on endeavour are its pilot , maj. frederick sturckow of the marine corps , and a mission specialist , sergei krikalev of the russian space agency . </s><s> after separating from the new outpost , the crew is to bring endeavour back to the kennedy space center on dec. 15 , with the mission length just shy of 12 days . </s><s> gretchen mcclain , nasa 's director in washington for the international space station , said in an interview here that its overall costs were actually small for individual americans . </s><s> over its lifetime , she said , the annual cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation 's 96 million taxpayers . </s><s> u.s. costs for construction , she added , were $ 24 billion , and for operations through the year 2012 were $ 10.4 billion , for a total of $ 34.4 billion . </s><s> most experts outside the agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billions of dollars spent in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle flights , which run about $ 800 million apiece .	endeavour astronauts launched on space station construction mission	endeavour launched .  crew to begin assembling international space station	shuttle endeavor launched for space station construction job .	friday shuttle launch flawless .  mission : attach us and russian modules .

less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles above the earth shortly before 6 p.m. , lt. col. nancy currie of the army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder as the craft

deploy from the module following its launch from kazakhstan on nov. 20 . </s><s> there were earlier indications that the antennas , which will be used later by the station to manually assist spacecraft dockings , had not extended . </s><s> currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move zarya above the american-made unity docking port positioned in endeavour 's cargo bay . </s><s> when the two pieces were aligned within inches of one another , cabana fired small thruster rockets that raised the shuttle , allowing the modules to clamp together . </s><s> the two station pieces , together measuring about 77 feet from end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 pounds , are the first of 100 major components to be united in space over the next five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a million pounds and span an area the size of two football fields . </s><s> more than 40 additional missions by u.s. shuttles and russian rockets will be used to haul

'' </s><s> many britons still view their country as weighed down by heavy class distinctions . </s><s> for example , tony smith , 36 , editor of several portuguese magazines in lisbon , seized an opportunity to study in vienna 14 years ago , and never looked back . </s><s> he has lived all over europe , and is fluent in portuguese , spanish , german , french and serbo-croatian . </s><s> his father , a car mechanic , had not traveled out of britain until 1992 . </s><s> smith said he could never have succeeded as well had he stayed home . </s><s> `` i did n't go to public schools or oxbridge , '' he explained . </s><s> `` i 'm not saying its impossible , but it would have been much more difficult in england . '' </s><s> yet continental europeans who flock to london find themselves bypassing english society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter as much . </s><s> ildiko iliffe , 30 , chose to work in london to escape the sexism she encountered on the continent . </s><s> mrs. iliffe , who is hungarian , speaks fluent english , german , french and italian , and met her canadian husband , roger iliffe , 30 , while both were attending the university of bocconi business school in milan in 1995 . </s><s> like his wife , iliffe speaks four languages and has lived and traveled all over the world . </s><s> she works on the eastern european desk of a british bank ; he works for a major international consulting firm . </s><s> originally they planned to work in italy , but mrs. iliffe said the prevailing attitude towards working women there made it impossible for her to find as good a job . </s><s> `` i went to job interviews at italian banks and they only asked me about my husband 's job , '' she said with a grimace . </s><s> `` and they made it clear that they were afraid i would get pregnant and ask for maternity leave .

'' </s><s> the answer obscures as much as it clarifies . </s><s> on one hand , the nobel prize has recognized world-renowned writers such as isaac bashevis singer and brought little-known wonders to light , such as wislawa szymborska . </s><s> but the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre , heaping attention on those who would have been more fairly served by obscurity . </s><s> among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901 , sully prudhomme . </s><s> that choice was denounced by sweden 's leading literary light , august strindberg , and a group of swedes sent a letter to leo tolstoy apologizing for the academy 's slight in not choosing him . </s><s> arguments over the academy 's choices are inevitable , considering the instructions they were given . </s><s> nobel 's will says the prize should recognize literature that works `` in an ideal direction .

'' </s><s> although saramago discounts the influence of latin american `` magical realism '' on his work , his novels often use the supernatural , allegorical , paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex questions of faith and existence . </s><s> many of his novels are set against a backdrop of political or historical events , but it is his unwavering concern for individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character . </s><s> his best-known books , all published in the united states , are `` baltasar and blimunda , '' `` the year of the death of ricardo reis , '' `` the stone raft '' and `` the history of the siege of lisbon . '' </s><s> his latest book available in english , `` blindness , '' in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind , was described as his `` symphonic new novel '' by andrew miller in the new york times book review on sunday . </s><s> `` there is no cynicism and there are no conclusions , just a clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are , a quality than can only honestly be termed as wisdom , '' miller , himself a novelist , wrote . </s><s> `` we should be grateful when it is handed to us in such generous measures . '' </s><s> saramago learned of his award thursday at frankfurt airport , where he was preparing to fly home via madrid to lanzarote in the canary islands after attending the frankfurt book fair . </s><s> earlier this week , he participated in a round-table of portuguese writers on the topic , `` why i am still a communist . '' </s><s> he immediately returned to the fair where he was received with cheers and bouquets of roses . </s><s> `` i am personally very happy for myself , '' he said . </s><s> `` i am also happy for my country . '' </s><s> later he told a news conference : `` the portuguese language had to wait 100 years for this . </s><s> there have to be ways and means of protecting the language so that it does not become a museum , but is something that is alive . </s><s> the writer 's role is to protect it and work with it . '' </s><s> the award was also celebrated in lisbon , where president jorge sampaio described it as `` recognition of portuguese culture , '' while the local communist leader , carlos carvalho , saw it as a credit to his own party . </s><s> `` as a member of our party , '' he noted solemnly , `` saramago makes a great contribution to our ideals and to the struggle for social change . '' </s><s> the laureate 's fiction , though , is never overtly political . </s><s> saramago , whose body of work includes poetry , essays , plays and a journal as well as 10 novels , is unusual for having emerged as a major literary figure only at the age of 60 . </s><s> his novels have since been translated into 30 languages , selling particularly well in portugal , brazil , spain , italy and germany . </s><s> while he has not been well known in the united states , his novels have always been critically well received there . </s><s> for all his late blooming , though , saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer . </s><s> born into a family of rural laborers and raised in lisbon , he was forced by poverty to leave school while a teen-ager and learn the trade of car mechanic . </s><s> yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 25 . </s><s> later , he found work at a lisbon publishing company , but the oppressive and censorial atmosphere of the salazar dictatorship discouraged him from writing . </s><s> it was only after portugal 's april 1974 revolution that saramago felt free to find his voice . </s><s> a member of the portuguese communist party since 1969 , he served as editor of a lisbon newspaper , diario de noticias , during an 18-month period when the left looked likely to seize power in portugal . </s><s> but an anti-communist backlash in november 1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating french texts into portuguese to make ends meet . </s><s> in the late 1970s , he also turned to novels , publishing three in succession in 1977 , 1978 and 1980 . </s><s> but it was in 1982 , with `` baltasar and blimunda '' ( `` memorial do convento '' in portuguese ) , that he achieved his international breakthrough . </s><s> `` this is a rich , multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time has a historical , a social and an individual perspective , '' the swedish academy noted thursday . </s><s> `` the insight and wealth of imagination to which it gives expression is characteristic of saramago 's work as a whole . '' </s><s> set in 18th-century portugal during the inquisition , the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran , baltasar , and a visionary , blimunda , to escape to the heavens aboard a flying machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory blimunda . </s><s> this fantastic story takes place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive mafra convent by thousands of men held in the grip of the inquisition . </s><s> when the novel was published in the united states in 1987 , irving howe acclaimed it as `` brilliant '' in the new york times book review . </s><s> `` mr. saramago is constantly present as a voice of european skepticism , a connoisseur of ironies , '' howe wrote . </s><s> `` i think i hear in his prose echoes of enlightenment sensibility , caustic and shrewd . '' </s><s> in his next novel , `` the year of the death of ricardo reis , '' which is also a homage to the great portuguese poet fernando pessoa , who appears in it as a ghost , saramago sets his story in the early years of the salazar dictatorship , with the tale following the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet-physician . </s><s> writing in the new york times , herbert mitgang called it `` a rare , old-fashioned novel _ at once lyrical , symbolic and meditative . '' </s><s> saramago , whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses , sought a different form of freedom in `` the stone raft , '' where he imagines the confusion unleashed when the iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of europe and begins drifting toward the new world and threatens to collide with the azores . </s><s> to the delight of britons , gibraltar is left behind . </s><s> unsurprisingly , the bitter satire , `` the gospel according to jesus christ , '' proved controversial , with god shown as using the innocently human jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance . </s><s> when a lisbon jury picked the book as portugal 's entry for a 1992 european literary prize , the country 's conservative government vetoed the choice as blasphemous . </s><s> it was then that saramago decided to leave his small , crowded apartment in lisbon for the relative solitude of lanzarote . </s><s> `` the history of the siege of lisbon , '' published in the united states last year , is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word `` not '' into a key passage in a standard history of portugal . </s><s> with this `` lunatic creative act , '' as edmund white put it in the new york times book review , he `` totally derails the national saga '' by affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate 12th-century lisbon from moorish occupation . </s><s> white ended his july 1997 review with a prescient remark . </s><s> `` word has it that saramago is overdue for a nobel prize , '' he noted . </s><s> `` no candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition than this novelist . '' </s><s> with the recent publication of `` blindness '' in the united states , only saramago 's latest novel , `` todos os nomes , '' or `` all the names '' still awaits translation into english . </s><s> in the tradition of andre gide and julian green , though , he has now embarked on his journals . </s><s> the fourth volume of these `` cadernos de lanzarote '' was just published in lisbon . </s><s> saramago will receive his nobel prize , worth the equivalent of $ 967,500 this year , at a ceremony in stockholm on dec. 10 .	jose saramago-first portuguese to win nobel prize in literature	jose saramago , 75-year-old portuguese writer awarded nobel for literature	1998 nobel for literature to jose saramago , imaginative portuguese novelist	jose saramago , first portuguese-language nobel literature laureate

medically	nitric oxide  nobel prize  heart disease  endothelium  blood pressure	three american pharmacologists were awarded the nobel prize on monday for their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas , nitric oxide , can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions . </s><s> those include widening blood vessels , helping to regulate blood pressure , initiating erections , battling infections , preventing formation of blood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the nervous system . </s><s> the prize , for physiology or medicine , went to dr. robert furchgott , 82 , of the state university of new york in brooklyn ; dr. louis ignarro , 57 , of the university of california at los angeles , and dr. ferid murad , 62 , of the university of texas medical school in houston . </s><s> the announcement of a significant phase of the discoveries by two of monday 's winners at a meeting in 1986 `` elicited an avalanche of research activities in many different laboratories around the world , '' said the nobel committee at the karolinska institute in stockholm , which makes the awards . </s><s> its citation said that the research had led to new treatments for treating heart and lung diseases , shock and impotence . </s><s> ignarro `` discovered the principle that led to the use of viagra as an anti-impotency drug , '' said dr. sten orrenius , a professor of toxicology at the karolinska institute . </s><s> nitric oxide starts the process by which blood vessels in the penis widen to produce an erection . </s><s> nitric oxide , a chemical relative of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide , is better known as a common air pollutant formed when nitrogen burns , such as in automobile exhaust fumes . </s><s> but scientists now know it is distributed widely in the body . </s><s> the discoveries honored on monday were made largely during the 1980s at a time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide but did not think it was important in animals and humans . </s><s> the award committee said that `` this was the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism . '' </s><s> the discovery was startling because `` nitric oxide is totally different from any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate and nitrite within 10 seconds . '' </s><s> recipients of the nobel prize , including some who have lobbied for it for years , often profess surprise on learning of their award . </s><s> this year 's winners were refreshingly candid . </s><s> furchgott said he had planned to sleep late on monday , a holiday , but was awakened at 5:30 at his home in hewlett , n.y . </s><s> he said that he knew that previous nobel prize winners had nominated him for the award , but that he still was `` somewhat surprised '' to receive it . </s><s> `` i guess i had some good friends voting , '' furchgott said . </s><s> he said he could not get back to sleep . </s><s> murad said he had `` pondered the odds and thought that maybe i could win the prize , if not now maybe in a couple of years . '' </s><s> he described the award as the culmination of a career and said that `` when it happens , it 's incredible . '' </s><s> ignarro was traveling in italy . </s><s> dr. gerald levey , the dean of ucla , said `` we actually anticipated this day for about four years now . '' </s><s> the three 1998 winners never worked together , `` but we talked a lot of shop talk at meetings , '' furchgott said . </s><s> dr. valentin fuster , the president of the american heart association and the head of cardiology at mt . </s><s> sinai hospital in manhattan , said that `` the discovery of nitric oxide and its function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular medicine . '' </s><s> doctors have learned from the prize-winning research that in heart disease , the endothelium , or inner lining of arteries , makes less nitric oxide . </s><s> drugs like nitroglycerine , however , can help replenish stores of nitric oxide . </s><s> now , drug companies are trying to develop more powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge of nitric oxide 's role as a signal molecule . </s><s> researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced in the endothelium rapidly spreads through cell membranes to the underlying muscle cells in arteries . </s><s> then it can shut off muscle contractions in the arteries , thus widening them and reducing blood pressure . </s><s> inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some people with certain lung diseases , particularly infants who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure . </s><s> but regulating the amount of nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal . </s><s> nitric oxide plays a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory system , or shock , resulting from overwhelming microbial infections . </s><s> bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release enormous amounts of nitric oxide . </s><s> as a result , blood pressure drops . </s><s> scientists are trying to develop drugs that can block production of nitric oxide in such infections . </s><s> white blood cells also play a role in attacking cancerous cells . </s><s> the gas can also induce a type of programmed cell death known as apoptosis . </s><s> scientists are studying nitric oxide 's effects on the immune system to stop the growth of cancers . </s><s> they are also exploring nitric oxide 's possible role in regulating body temperature . </s><s> doctors are measuring the production of nitric oxide in the lungs and intestines to diagnose a number of ailments , including asthma and colitis , and are studying its role in menstruation . </s><s> nitric oxide formed in nerve cells spreads rapidly in all directions to activate cells in the vicinity and influence many functions , like behavior and the mobility of the intestinal tract . </s><s> nitric oxide is also being studied for its role in smell and memory . </s><s> nitric oxide 's role is still unfolding ; scientists have written thousands of scientific papers about it in recent years and have started a journal , nitric oxide . </s><s> the nobel committee cited furchgott for performing in 1980 `` an ingenious experiment '' that showed that a drug , acetylcholine , widened blood vessels only if the inner layer , or endothelium , was intact . </s><s> furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he called edrf , for endothelium-derived relaxing factor , which relaxes smooth muscle cells in blood vessels . </s><s> furchgott 's findings `` led to a quest to identify the factor , '' the citation said . </s><s> ( optional trim can begin here ) the citation did not refer to an accident in furchgott 's laboratory that played a major role in his discoveries . </s><s> in 1995 , in the annual review of pharmacology and toxicology , furchgott wrote that on may 5 , 1978 , in the first of a series of planned experiments on arteries from a rabbit , a technician did not follow directions correctly . </s><s> the technician performed one step of the experiment before instead of after he was supposed to wash out a drug used in an earlier phase of the experiment . </s><s> furchgott expected that the arteries would contract . </s><s> instead , they relaxed . </s><s> it was the first time he had seen the drugs under study produce such a reaction , and he used the insight to plan additional experiments . </s><s> furchgott omitted the technician 's name in that paper and in another in 1996 in the journal of the american medical association . </s><s> on monday , he said david davidson was the technician . </s><s> ( optional trim ends here ) the committee cited ignarro for concluding in 1986 , from `` a brilliant series of analyses '' conducted independently of furchgott , that edrf was identical to nitric oxide . </s><s> furchgott said he and ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in 1986 at the mayo clinic in rochester , minn. , but the papers were not published until 1998 . </s><s> murad was cited for work conducted over the years while he worked at the university of virginia in charlottesville , stanford university in palo alto , calif. , and abbott laboratories in illinois . </s><s> murad said he felt fortunate to have heard furchgott report his early work on edrf in 1980 . </s><s> murad showed that a gas could regulate important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide . </s><s> ( optional trim can begin here ) in his early training at case western reserve university in cleveland , murad worked in the laboratory of dr. theodore rall , who also trained another nobel prize winner , dr. alfred gilman of the university of texas southwestern in dallas . </s><s> gilman said in an interview that he believed rall , now retired and living in charlottesville , va. , was the first scientist to have trained two nobel prize winners . </s><s> in addition , rall worked with dr. earl sutherland , who also won a nobel prize . </s><s> in his early reseach years , murad worked on a chemical known as cyclic guanosine monophosphate , which later turned out to be critical in the nitric oxide story . </s><s> murad 's trainees referred to the early work as `` dumping experiments '' because all they could do in the laboratory at the time was crudely add various hormones and agents to slices of tissue , cell cultures . </s><s> it took years to develop the more refined techniques that led to the understanding of nitric oxide 's many roles in the body . </s><s> but for many years , most of the scientific community was skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric oxide to activate an enzyme , murad said in 1996 when he and furchgott shared the albert lasker basic medical research award . </s><s> ( optional trim ends here ) the nobel prizes were created by the will of alfred nobel , whose invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine . </s><s> the award committee noted an odd twist to this year 's award . </s><s> when nobel developed chest pain from heart disease , it said , he refused to take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused headache . </s><s> nobel dismissed nitroglycerine 's benefit in the relief of chest pain . </s><s> nobel died in 1896 . </s><s> the prize that the three scientists will share is now worth $ 938,000 .	three american pharmacologists win nobel prize in medicine	us pharmacologists work with nitric oxide captures nobel medicine prize	3 us nobelists ' 1980s nitric oxide discoveries highly important medically	nitric oxide , nobel prize , heart disease , endothelium , blood pressure

'' </s><s> in assuming the role of foreign minister , however , he would be forced to abandon his public opposition to netanyahu 's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the palestinian territory _ even if he votes against the accord . </s><s> sharon will be drawn directly into the issue , since netanyahu has appointed him to direct the final status talks with the palestinians , which would follow the signing of an interim peace agreement . </s><s> last week sharon told an israeli newspaper that , negotiations or not , he would never shake the hand of yasser arafat , the palestinian leader , whom he has long disdained . </s><s> palestinian leaders and israeli leftists were divided in their reactions , in similar ways . </s><s> some professed to be aghast , and some , like nabil sha'ath , the palestinian transportation minister , said they were willing to `` forget history '' if sharon 's appointment provided netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal . </s><s> in washington , white house and state department officials pledged to work closely with sharon and emphasized that the personnel in an israeli government are an internal affair . </s><s> `` arik sharon is the most fitting person in the state of israel for the position of foreign minister , '' netanyahu said , using his nickname . </s><s> `` he brings with him rich experience , creativity , proven working ability and i think that he well knows both the wounds and damages of war as well as the fruits of peace . </s><s> `` sharon has never hidden his beliefs , '' he continued , `` and his words have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried out if not its extent . '' </s><s> in a nod to sharon , netanyahu has decided on a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent of the west bank land . </s><s> it was supposed to be in the judean desert near israel 's eastern border , which sharon argued would pose a strategic security risk . </s><s> instead , it was decided on thursday that the nature reserve would instead be on the slopes of the hebron hills , much closer to existing jewish settlements . </s><s> many israeli political observers believe that netanyahu has eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this appointment , signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace agreement . </s><s> `` who is the right wing now if sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the palestinians ? '' </s><s> asked uzi benziman , an editorial board member of the newspaper haaretz and author of a critical biography of sharon . </s><s> `` it will be just the settlers and some real hard-liners who do n't comprise more than 15 percent of public opinion . </s><s> so it 's really quite an intelligent move , suggesting that netanyahu means business in trying to get an agreement . '' </s><s> but the palestinians took the news hard , and read it differently . </s><s> `` i think it 's a clear-cut message from bibi , '' saeb erekat , a lead negotiator for the palestinians , said , using netanyahu 's nickname . </s><s> `` i imagine people will try to explain netanyahu 's intentions as trying to get the support of the right . </s><s> what he is trying to do is make peace with the right wing at the expense of making peace with us . </s><s> it means he wants to continue on the path of non-negotiations , because he wants to continue to be prime minister at any cost . '' </s><s> sharon declined to be interviewed friday because his appointment must still be approved by the cabinet on tuesday , an approval that is expected . </s><s> an aide , raanan gisin , said sharon accepted the position so that he could `` stem the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the risks facing israel . '' </s><s> a retired general who fought in every israeli war , sharon , 70 , is a leading figure of the likud party who has done much battle with the likud prime minister . </s><s> at the most recent party convention , he said that netanyahu did n't know his right hand from his left , which the prime minister dismissed friday as a comment made `` in the height of political arguments . '' </s><s> and when netanyahu first formed his cabinet in 1996 , the fact that he did not give sharon a senior position caused an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in ceremony . </s><s> sharon retreated to his family farm in the negev , and david levy , who had been named foreign minister , said he would not serve unless sharon was given a post . </s><s> netanyahu then created a cabinet job , the minister of infrastructures , especially for sharon . </s><s> levy resigned in january after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister , and since then netanyahu has been serving as his own foreign minister . </s><s> sharon , a member of the old guard , has a complicated political past , highlighted by a string of military victories , and checkered , to many , by his indirect role , as defense minister , in the lebanese christian phalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the sabra and shatila refugee camps in lebanon in 1982 . </s><s> many israelis , even those who despise his politics , see him as a strong , experienced figure who knows his mind and who is capable of being moderate when he has power . </s><s> friday afternoon , the right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded the appointment . </s><s> uzi landau , who is a likud hard-liner , said he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a rumor for weeks . </s><s> `` i feel more safe about the negotiations if minister sharon is directly involved , '' said landau , who heads the parliament 's security and foreign affairs committee . </s><s> `` undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation for the prime minister to show the right that arik sharon is identified with the program , so therefore they can live with it . '' </s><s> right before the announcement was made , leaders of the national religious party , who had threatened to bring down the government , changed their combative tone . </s><s> they emerged mollified from meetings with netanyahu late thursday , saying they would leave the government intact . </s><s> still , they would not connect their change of heart to the nomination of sharon . </s><s> `` appointing sharon is a political step we like very much , '' said shaul yahalom , the minister of transportation and a leader of the national religious party . </s><s> `` but it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement . </s><s> our concern there is on whether any of the 160 jewish settlements are endangered . '' </s><s> the appointment of sharon comes against a backdrop of violence that has erupted this week . </s><s> friday , a 19-year-old israeli soldier , michal adato , was stabbed to death by a palestinian man as she got off a bus in her hometown , the settlement of tomer in the jordan valley . </s><s> netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy note from arafat , who condemned the attack . </s><s> also friday , in the continuing clashes between palestinian youths and soldiers in the divided city of hebron , 32 palestinians were lightly injured by rubber bullets after the funeral of a palestinian protester shot dead on thursday . </s><s> after netanyahu made the announcement friday , an israeli reporter introduced a question by stating that netanyahu had diminished the political threat from the right wing by appointing sharon . </s><s> `` are you willing to sign on that ? '' </s><s> netanyahu said . </s><s> `` i do not know that . </s><s> i do know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or two people you can never know what will be . '' </s><s> he was referring to his razor-thin majority in parliament _ which some analysts perceive to be his key motivator in appointing sharon . </s><s> `` more than anything else , this reflects the political weakness of netanyahu , '' said yaron ezrahi , a leading intellectual and critic of the prime minister . </s><s> `` he has recognized that the next redeployment is inevitable if he does n't want to be seen as contributing to the wave of political violence that would follow a failure . </s><s> but he does n't have the domestic political power to carry out the big decision on his own .

plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern gaza strip at 8:30 a.m. ( 0630 gmt ) . </s><s> but the emotional highlight was the touchdown of the first palestinian airlines plane , a fokker 50 . </s><s> after landing , the pilot and co-pilot raised palestinian flags high above their heads as they descended the stairway . </s><s> a chant of `` allahu akbar , '' or god is great , rose from of a crowd of thousands of palestinians who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations . </s><s> `` you are a beautiful sight , '' palestinian leader yasser arafat later told the palestinian crew in the vip lounge lavishly decorated with deep red oriental carpets and wall mosaics . </s><s> throughout the morning , arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes from egypt , morocco , jordan , spain , the european union and two palestinian airlines flights . </s><s> `` this is a preparation for the declaration of the palestinian state , '' arafat said , smiling broadly and flashing a v sign . </s><s> however , israel continues to control the airspace and has the authority to shut down the airfield at any time . </s><s> it will monitor arriving passengers and cargo , and can keep travelers or goods out if it considers them a danger to israeli security . </s><s> disputes between israel and the palestinian authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years . </s><s> in a sign of cooperation , israeli and palestinian security agents approached the egypt air jet together tuesday and collected the passports of the passengers , including egyptian cabinet ministers and comedian adel imam , in white bags . </s><s> throughout the morning , there were spontaneous celebrations . </s><s> as a police marching band played bagpipes , airport workers , policemen and cabinet ministers held each other by their hands and danced in a circle . </s><s> some kissed and embraced their neighbors , others wiped away tears and several officers waved their rifles in the air . </s><s> in one corner of the airfield , about 300 people gathered around a man and a boy riding mules that moved to the beat of drums . </s><s> the dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled palestinian economy , permitting the export of palestinian flowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via israel , often with difficulties and delays . </s><s> the airfield will also make it easier for palestinians to travel abroad , although a majority of gazans are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket . </s><s> until now , palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter israel and fly out of ben gurion international airport near tel aviv . </s><s> the other

reasons . </s><s> however , israeli foreign minister ariel sharon said tuesday that this might change in the future . </s><s> the opening of the airport was negotiated during last month 's

installed in a van . </s><s> despite its temporary shortcomings , many palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence . </s><s> for those living in the small , overcrowded gaza strip , which is ringed by the mediterranean on one side and by barbed wire on the other three , it may help ease the feeling of being trapped . </s><s> `` now we will be able to travel without the israeli

consider merge  create large us company  cite bpamoco	exxon corp. and mobil corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations , a person involved in the talks said wednesday . </s><s> it was unclear wednesday whether talks were continuing . </s><s> if the companies were to merge , it would create the largest u.s. company in terms of revenue . </s><s> a possible merger was reported separately by both the financial times of london and bloomberg news . </s><s> the reported talks between exxon , whose annual revenue exceeds that of wal-mart and general electric , and mobil , the no . </s><s> 2 u.s. oil company , come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years . </s><s> a combined company would be bigger than royal dutch/shell group , the world 's largest oil company by revenue . </s><s> financial terms of the discussions could not be determined wednesday . </s><s> neither exxon or mobil would comment . </s><s> any union would reunite two parts of john d. rockefeller 's standard oil trust , which was broken up by the supreme court in 1911 . </s><s> exxon was then known as standard oil of new jersey , and mobil consisted of two companies : standard oil of new york and vacuum oil . </s><s> both exxon , which has a market value of $ 176.7 billion , and mobil , which has a market value of $ 61.1 billion , have a history of being fiercely independence . </s><s> both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean in order to survive long periods when oil prices are low . </s><s> but this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry , and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon . </s><s> consequently , chief executives of most oil companies have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners . </s><s> this summer , british petroleum announced a $ 48.2 billion agreement to buy amoco corp. , creating the world 's third-largest oil company and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation . </s><s> `` it showed that megamergers are doable , '' said adam sieminski , an analyst for bt alex . </s><s> brown . </s><s> he added , however , that a combination between exxon and mobil would not be an easy match because mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge . </s><s> exxon , he added , is a `` well run company that likes to grow its own businesses . '' </s><s> he added that the heads of both companies , lee raymond , the chairman of exxon , which is based in irving , texas , and lucio noto , the chairman , president and chief executive of mobil , which is based in fairfax , va. , are different personalities . </s><s> `` it will not be easy , '' he said of combining the two far-flung companies , which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the united states and europe . </s><s> `` if you offer enough money you can make anything happen , '' he added . </s><s> both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term . </s><s> like other oil companies , they had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserves of russia . </s><s> even though they were prepared to spend billions , they have held back because of the political and economic crisis in russia and great reluctance by russian officials and oil companies to give up control of vast fields . </s><s> thus they have had to fall back on their own exploration areas such as the deep waters in the gulf of mexico and west africa . </s><s> such exploration is very expensive , and even when large fields are found it often takes platforms costing $ 1 billion to bring the oil into production . </s><s> oil prices have been under pressure for more than a year , falling more than 40 percent from the $ 20-a-barrel level because of growing inventories of petroleum and declining asian demand caused by the economic crisis there . </s><s> on wednesday , crude oil for january delivery fell 29 cents , or 2.6 percent , to $ 11.86 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange , close to the 12-year low of $ 11.42 reached on june 15 . </s><s> members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and some other oil-producing nations , notably mexico , have tried to stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production . </s><s> but those pledges have not always been honored , and rallies in the oil market this year have proven short-lived . </s><s> opec members on wednesday continued their discussion on extending their production cutbacks , and an agreement is expected as early as thursday . </s><s> in the spring , opec agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day , about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels . </s><s> the main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil prices from falling below $ 10 a barrel . </s><s> washington regulators said wednesday that they had not been notified about the exxon-mobil discussions . </s><s> the federal trade commission is still reviewing british petroleum 's pending purchase of amoco . </s><s> an exxon-mobil deal would be certain to receive several months ' worth of scrutiny by the commission , which would review how much of the industry such a merger would control . </s><s> analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of the possible merger . </s><s> some pointed to difficulties that the companies could face if they were combined . </s><s> `` if you asked me if exxon needed to be bigger , the answer is probably no , '' said garfield miller , president of aegis energy advisors corp. , a small independent investment bank based in new york . </s><s> `` it is hard to say that there is anything in particular to gain . '' </s><s> in particular , miller said , the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses . </s><s> `` they really do overlap quite a bit , '' he said . </s><s> `` you really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy . '' </s><s> another investment banker in the energy business , speaking on the condition of anonymity , also questioned the rationale for the discussed merger . </s><s> `` when you look at the bp-amoco deal , you can rationalize it , '' the banker said . </s><s> `` but none of those reasons apply to an exxon-mobil deal . '' </s><s> but amy jaffe , an energy research analyst with the james a. baker iii institute for public policy , said the combination of the two companies would be logical , in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding for projects in middle eastern countries . </s><s> `` this is a deal that makes sense , '' ms. jaffe said . </s><s> `` with this combined company , there is no project that would be too big . '' </s><s> in addition , ms. jaffe said , the merger would provide each company with new oil and gas assets in areas of the world where they had little influence . </s><s> `` there are a lot of complimentary assets where they are not redundant , '' she said . </s><s> she said that exxon , for example , has a strong presence in angola , while mobil does not . </s><s> and mobil has significant assets in the caspian sea and nigeria , where exxon is weak .	exxon and mobil discuss combining business operations ; possible merger .	possible merger of exxon and mobile would create largest u.s. company	exxon corp. and mobil corp may combine business operations	exxon , mobil consider merge , creating largest us company .  cite bp-amoco .

giants in the energy patch , were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue . </s><s> even before that combination came to light , deal-making was fast and furious . </s><s> on monday alone , $ 40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent . </s><s> driving the resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market , the recognition by major corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues internally and growing confidence among market players that the economy will not plunge into a recession next year . </s><s> there are also industry-specific issues , like low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants into one another 's arms . </s><s> but for investors , mega-marriages are not where the real money is to be made . </s><s> rather , it is among smaller companies , whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with stocks that again are near their peaks . </s><s> if exxon buys mobil at close to current prices , deals this month will have a total value of more than $ 140 billion _ off from april 's peak of $ 244 billion but three times the volume in september , when the stock market was falling . </s><s> which industries are likely to witness the most mergers ? </s><s> tom burnett , director of merger insight , an institutional investment advisory firm in new york , says more deals are a certainty in energy , which is suffering from low crude-oil prices . </s><s> burnett also says health care executives are finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings . </s><s> but smaller companies may be a better way to play the takeover game . </s><s> charles laloggia , editor of the special situation investor newsletter in potomac , md. , said : `` some of the premiums in high-profile mergers are n't so great anymore . </s><s> the values are in small-cap stocks . '' </s><s> another reason is that deals involving smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath of antitrust regulators . </s><s> laloggia reckons that the odds of picking takeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already partially owned by another . </s><s> in the energy sector , houston exploration qualifies , he says ; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by keyspan energy . </s><s> he also believes more deals are imminent among drug chains and supermarkets . </s><s> longs drug stores and drug emporium , he says , remain acquisition candidates , though neither is controlled by another concern . </s><s> in supermarkets , laloggia likes the great atlantic & amp ; pacific tea co. , 55 percent owned by tengelmann group of germany . </s><s> another pick is smart and final , an operator of warehouse-style stores that is 55 percent owned by the u.s. subsidiary of groupe casino , france 's largest supermarket chain . </s><s> `` both a & amp ; p and smart and final are trading at just about book value , '' laloggia said . </s><s> takeovers typically occur above book value . </s><s> finally , he recommends national presto industries , a maker of housewares and electrical appliances , which is trading near $ 39 , close to its low for the year . </s><s> the company has $ 30 a share in cash on its balance sheet , no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent . </s><s> after last month 's announced acquisition of rubbermaid by the newell co. , laloggia thinks national presto could find itself in an acquirer 's cross-hairs .	exxon-mobil merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue .	growing stock market , need to increase revenue , driving merger talks	exxon-mobil merger talks are sign corporate marriages are back in vogue	exxon-mobil talks sign of merger increase .  internal revenue increases tough

notion that hardship is driving profitable big oil to either merge , as british petroleum and amoco have already agreed to do , or at least to consider the prospect , as exxon and mobil are doing . </s><s> still , big oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration . </s><s> given the exotic locales of the most promising , untapped fields , it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper . </s><s> and with west texas crude trading at around $ 12 a barrel , it seems a safe bet oil that wo n't be selling for $ 100 a barrel by the turn of the century _ a price some analysts in the early 1980s were predicting it would reach . </s><s> philip k. verleger jr. , publisher of petroleum economics monthly and a senior adviser to the brattle group , a cambridge , mass. , consulting firm , spent some time late last week talking about mobil , exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business . </s><s> following are excerpts from the conversation : q . </s><s> ( italics ) there is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an exxon-mobil deal . </s><s> do you see any problems ? </s><s> ( end italics ) a . </s><s> let me say right off that i do n't think this is a done deal . </s><s> i think it is far from that . </s><s> but if it were to happen , i do n't see many problems . </s><s> bp amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger , one in which there is little or no overlap with the company you are merging with . </s><s> exxon-mobil comes close . </s><s> the first issue is competition in local markets . </s><s> the only possible problem area there is on the west coast , but both companies are pretty small players there . </s><s> if there is a reason this merger might get extra attention , it will be because exxon and mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the clinton administration 's or the european union 's positions on global warming . </s><s> q . </s><s> ( italics ) why are you skeptical about the deal ? </s><s> ( end italics ) a . </s><s> well , mobil has been trying to get bigger . </s><s> they had talks with amoco . </s><s> they wanted to buy conoco . </s><s> but i do n't understand where lucio noto , mobil 's chief executive , fits into this . </s><s> that could be an impediment to an agreement , because in a merger i do n't think he has a place , and he has been a very strong leader . </s><s> q . </s><s> ( italics ) mobil is the country 's second-biggest oil company , behind exxon . </s><s> why do they need to get bigger ? </s><s> ( end italics ) a . </s><s> in the first decade of the next century , the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive , and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game : royal dutch , exxon and bp amoco . </s><s> companies of mobil 's size are probably marginal players . </s><s> q . </s><s> ( italics ) that suggests mobil has been harder hit than exxon by the downturn in prices . </s><s> ( end italics ) a . </s><s> from 1988 to 1996 , exxon 's exploration and production expenditures rose 8 percent . </s><s> mobil 's rose 14 percent . </s><s> but mobil 's expenditures were much more sensitive to price elasticities of oil than exxon 's . </s><s> they were pushing the envelope , and when prices fell they had to cut back . </s><s> exxon has tried to build a very large presence systematically , without paying much attention to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices . </s><s> they are brutally efficient . </s><s> q . </s><s> ( italics ) earlier this month the energy department said oil prices would stay soft for nearly a decade . </s><s> do you agree ? </s><s> ( end italics ) a . </s><s> you know , every time i see forecasts that go out that far i want to go out and buy stock in oil companies . </s><s> i think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year . </s><s> it is conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at $ 5 a barrel , depending on what happens to the world economy . </s><s> during that period , we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production , leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-opec countries . </s><s> that will strengthen the hands of the opec countries . </s><s> and when the asian economies start growing again that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices , say $ 20 a barrel , in the next 18 months . </s><s> q . </s><s> ( italics ) the number of oil companies is going to shrink in coming years , regardless , is n't it ? </s><s> ( end italics ) a . </s><s> we are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies , possibly eight . </s><s> there is really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society . </s><s> q . </s><s> ( italics ) do you think oil stocks are a good investment ? </s><s> ( end italics ) a. i think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment , but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 months . </s><s> and it is an area where investors need to be careful , because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller companies .	low petroleum prices , high cost of exploration motives for possible merger .	low petroleum prices

largest oil companies , confirmed friday that they were discussing a possible merger , and antitrust lawyers , industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth . </s><s> those divestitures would further reshape an industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the low price of oil . </s><s> but the mergers and other corporate combinations are also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust officials , one that may prove particularly challenging to exxon and mobil . </s><s> although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing the possibility of a merger , a person close to the discussions said the boards of both exxon and mobil were expected to meet tuesday to consider an agreement . </s><s> shares of both surged on the new york stock exchange . </s><s> oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily present antitrust problems in an exxon-mobil merger because competition in those areas is brisk . </s><s> but in retailing and marketing operations , an exxon-mobil combination would be `` like ford merging with general motors , macy 's with gimbels , '' said stephen axinn , an antitrust lawyer in new york who represented texaco in its acquisition of getty more than a decade ago . </s><s> in the united states , the deal would come under the purview of the federal trade commission , which under the clinton administration has examined large corporate mergers with a vigor not seen since the 1970s . </s><s> the agency has blocked a number of proposed mergers , such as the $ 4 billion combination of staples and office depot , the two largest office supply discounters , and two deals involving the four largest drug wholesalers . </s><s> on the other hand it has approved other big mergers , such as boeing 's $ 14 billion acquisition of mcdonnell douglas . </s><s> the agency 's analysis of an exxon-mobil combination , a senior official said friday , will turn on how it might resemble john d. rockefeller 's standard oil trust before it was dismantled by the supreme court in 1911 . </s><s> `` the big antitrust issue is whether , by a merger or alliance , they will be able to get the competition of one another off their backs , particularly against the background of bp-amoco and shell-texaco , '' said eleanor m. fox , a professor at the new york university school of law and an antitrust expert . </s><s> `` it may be that we are looking at a consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation on the national level 100 years ago . '' </s><s> the federal trade commission recently approved a significant joint venture between shell and texaco after the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing operations in hawaii and california . </s><s> it is also considering the proposed $ 54 billion merger of british petroleum and amoco and will now have to re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between exxon and mobil . </s><s> `` in the past , when there have been two mergers involving the same industry , the government has considered them together in deciding how to deal with them , '' said terry calvani , a former commissioner at the federal trade commission whose clients now include chevron . </s><s> but coming in the aftermath of the shell-texaco and bp-amoco deals , a combination of exxon and mobil , which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the united states and europe , poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s . </s><s> `` it 's a real test case , '' said frederick leuffer , a senior energy analyst at bear stearns . </s><s> `` if the ftc let this one go through without major divesting , then everything would be fair game . </s><s> why could n't gm merge with ford ? '' </s><s> while the 1911 breakup of standard oil is viewed by washington officials and industry executives as ancient history , exxon and mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and refining markets , and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals . </s><s> leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case `` could be so large that they are deal-breakers . '' </s><s> other analysts and lawyers , while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal , said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituents , including competitors , customers and state officials . </s><s> `` these are not absolute obstacles , '' said john hervey , an analyst at donaldson lufkin & amp ; jenrette . </s><s> in the past , when two big oil companies have merged , aggressive attorneys general from the states have almost always become involved in raising questions because of the high visibility of the local gas station . </s><s> `` when a state attorney general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them are mobil and exxon , they are certain to raise questions , '' axinn said . </s><s> exxon and mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and marketing concerns in the northeast , the southwest and the west coast , where they also have big refining operations . </s><s> because the two companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing , the meaning of the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort out . </s><s> the regulators examining such a transaction would dissect each business , determine whether its market is global , national or more local , and determine whether the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in those areas . </s><s> experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit exxon and mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher prices . </s><s> hervey said those markets are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major american and european oil companies is only 17 percent .	experts say a possible exxon-mobil merger would entail divestitures .	a merger of exxon and mobile could spark anti-trust scrutiny	possible exxon-mobil merger would require sale of large corporate pieces	exxon , mobil confirm talks .  anti-trust case , sale of large units seen .

largest domestic refinery , out of about 1,500 a decade ago , heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with exxon , it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow . </s><s> `` i think it 's a terrible thing , '' said dick mabry , a refinery operator , as he emerged in the plant 's artificial twilight from the main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 on sunday morning . </s><s> he stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red , but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed . </s><s> `` it 's a revival of the standard oil company . </s><s> it 's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work . </s><s> i think the justice department should step in and stop it . '' </s><s> ernest lewis , whose overalls bore a `` big e '' patch appropriate to his scale , added his uh-huh 's . </s><s> the latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby , he said , glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery 's generators . </s><s> but if the mobil corp. has to be sold , lewis said , noting the gains in his company stock holdings , a buyer as solid and large as the exxon corp. might be the least of all evils . </s><s> `` if we merged with chevron , we 'd be moron , '' he added . </s><s> a growing american economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries , in petroleum as much as any . </s><s> those here point to the tote board by the beaumont plant 's brick headquarters , that they say shows they have already handled 171 million barrels out of 130 million planned for the full year . </s><s> but the numbers that matter even more are the ones like 89.9 , 88.9 , even 81.9 , on nearby gas stations _ the lowest prices , after inflation , since the depression . </s><s> which is why mobil and exxon are considering combining into the world 's largest oil company . </s><s> some people close to the talks cautioned that no deal would be considered by their boards until at least tuesday , maybe wednesday . </s><s> and that is why , beginning last wednesday evening , the phone at the home of jimmy herrington , the president of the oil , chemical and atomic workers local 4-243 rang without stop . </s><s> no , he did n't know about that merger talk on television , said herrington , who also works full-time producing lubricants . </s><s> he had asked some mobil managers , in a meeting earlier this month , about all the rumors , but they said they had heard nothing . </s><s> oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company 's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals , like geologists and engineers , in the field . </s><s> one company 's accountants could almost do the work for two . </s><s> but the crews here fully expect that an exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline , motor oil and other products with even fewer people . </s><s> union leaders raise the prospect that exxon would have to sell the refinery . </s><s> antitrust regulators , they say , are bound to notice that exxon has refineries an hour 's drive in one direction and three hours in the other , along a gulf of mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical industry 's home . </s><s> the beaumont plant , a steaming , humming chemistry set lining the neches river off the gulf , has become the prime provider of livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the nearby spindletop gusher . </s><s> with mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more , workers regularly make $ 55,000 or $ 65,000 a year . </s><s> `` people go there to retire there , '' herrington said , as he drove around the plant 's fenced periphery . </s><s> lewis , in his 17th year , is a third-generation employee . </s><s> but his nephew laboring here too is the exception . </s><s> the workers streaming to and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray , a sign that for a full generation the refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them . </s><s> the cutbacks have , so far , come through attrition , with retirements often encouraged by incentives . </s><s> but the plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around herrington 's union hall advertise that the best times are long gone . </s><s> his members chafe at the experts who come in from wall street to question the justification for every person 's job . </s><s> in tiring and dangerous tasks , they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime ( although some like the extra pay , and they say the plant has become safer over the years ) . </s><s> they complain about the growing numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks . </s><s> but with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement savings in mobil stock , a 1990s ethos is gaining . </s><s> some share credit with the plant 's management for the efficiency measures they agree are necessary for true job security . </s><s> some take the attitude that every company is always for sale . </s><s> `` they will not be too concerned about what we feel about it , '' said sam salim , one of the electrical plant workers whose future is uncertain . </s><s> `` but if they fork out $ 60 billion ? </s><s> i 'd look it over . '' </s><s> with most mobil executives saying as little as possible for now , calls on sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman did not elicit a peep . </s><s> union leaders , however , are already squawking . </s><s> ''i do n't believe creating new monopolies is the way to prop up the industry , '' said robert wages , a former refinery operator himself and now the union 's president , by telephone saturday . </s><s> nevertheless , with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause in last november 's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have to keep to its terms . </s><s> many members , who typically came to work after high school , are already molding the oil companies ' latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious mba 's . </s><s> `` they 're the biggest , '' said bobby whisneant , an assistant operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units , referring to exxon . </s><s> he was coming , early on sunday morning , through a plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station . </s><s> `` so they go buy the second biggest . </s><s> that 's one way to get rid of the competition . </s><s> i just hope it 's not something like the 80s _ buying companies and scrapping them .

saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on president clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit congress in six months . </s><s> he urged the president to follow his example and quit , too . </s><s> but at the white house , where calls for clinton 's resignation are derided as a republican strategy , the president sent a spokesman into the driveway to urge livingston to reconsider his resignation . </s><s> livingston stood in the well of the house he has served for two decades and called on clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the senate , drawing boos from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead . </s><s> `` i must set the example that i hope president clinton will follow , '' livingston announced to a shocked and silent chamber in an act that left the republican party in total chaos just hours before the vote to impeach clinton . </s><s> the decision also left the party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th congress , when republicans must govern with one of the narrowest majorities in history . </s><s> several republicans , including rep. tom delay of texas , the majority whip , somberly welcomed the news , suggesting it relieved them of an excruciating embarrassment . </s><s> in lauding livingston 's move , delay said , `` he understood what this debate was all about _ it 's about honor and decency and integrity and the truth , everything we honor in this country . '' </s><s> but democrats said they were aghast , and many _ including clinton _ called on livingston to reconsider his decision . </s><s> `` mr. livingston 's resignation was wrong , '' declared rep. jerrold nadler , d-n.y. `` it is a surrender to a developing sexual mccarthyism . </s><s> are we going to have a new test if someone wants to run for public office _ are you now or have you ever been an adulterer ? '' </s><s> he called on the country to distinguish between sins and crimes . </s><s> white house press secretary joe lockhart said clinton was `` disappointed '' at the news of livingston 's plans and wished that he would reconsider . </s><s> lockhart said the president `` firmly believes that the politics of personal destruction in this town and this country has to come to an end . '' </s><s> he reaffirmed that clinton would not resign , saying : `` the president is going to do what 's in the best interest of the country . </s><s> it would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction . '' </s><s> livingston 's announced resignation was all the more stunning for its disclosure in a process that could result in the president 's removal from office . </s><s> the speaker is second in line to the presidency , after the vice president . </s><s> newt gingrich , the outgoing speaker , who was driven from the post after republicans lost five seats in the november election , technically remains speaker until jan. 6 , when livingston 's election was to be ratified by the new congress . </s><s> but gingrich has removed himself from the daily operations of the house at this extraordinary session and has begun to dismantle his office . </s><s> livingston 's decision was said to be driven in part by the anger of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party who were disillusioned that he had withheld news of his affairs from them . </s><s> they had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election in january that would formally make him speaker . </s><s> he was also concerned about the pain caused to his family by further disclosures , some members said . </s><s> they added that , not lost on many in his party , was the example he would set for the president by offering to resign his post now . </s><s> delay , no . </s><s> 3 in the house republican leadership , is expected to fill the power vacuum at least temporarily , in deed if not in title , while the party regroups to find a new speaker . </s><s> many members quickly rallied around rep. dennis hastert of illinois . </s><s> hastert , one of delay 's deputy whips who is well respected among his colleagues , had been promoted as a candidate for majority leader last month , but never mounted a campaign . </s><s> rep. dick armey of texas only precariously held on to his majority-leader post last month and was not considered a likely candidate for speaker . </s><s> he is expected to manage the reorganization , which republican leaders have set for jan. 4 . </s><s> livingston met privately with his closest advisers friday as the impeachment debate unfolded . </s><s> some of his colleagues believed he had made a mistake in disclosing thursday night _ just as the house was moving into the divisive debate over impeachment _ that he had `` on occasion strayed from my marriage . '' </s><s> he told republican leaders late thursday afternoon that hustler magazine was going to expose his affairs early next year . </s><s> some leaders urged him to keep quiet , but his wife , bonnie , encouraged him to tell his colleagues immediately , despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor . </s><s> at that point thursday night , roll call , a newspaper on capitol hill , reported on its web site that livingston was going to admit to the affairs and was going to offer to resign . </s><s> in a closed-door meeting with his fellow republicans , he did admit to the affairs but made no offer to step down , receiving three standing ovations instead . </s><s> thursday night , livingston stated that he would `` not be intimidated by these efforts '' to exploit his past . </s><s> but friday he removed himself from public action and that night drew his closest advisers into his confidence . </s><s> his aides said saturday that they had no clue what was he was contemplating , and few other members were aware of his plans . </s><s> asked if he had any advance word , rep. j.c. watts of oklahoma , a newly elected member of the republican leadership , said : `` i had no idea . '' </s><s> asked if there had been internal party pressure on livingston to resign , rep. harold rogers , r-ky. , said : `` i did n't know about it if there was , '' but added , `` there were some members who were critical of it . '' </s><s> as the leaders tried saturday to hold the party together on and off the house floor , most republicans stuck to their prepared scripts on the floor in favor of impeaching the president . </s><s> but some began expressing their anguish . </s><s> rep. henry hyde , r-ill. , who admitted to his own adulterous affair earlier this year , said after livingston 's resignation : `` those of us who are sinners must feel wretched today . </s><s> something is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped , and that is a confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts . '' </s><s> to much applause , hyde declared : `` congress has no business intruding into private acts . '' </s><s> republicans , indeed livingston himself , had made this same distinction between clinton 's sexual indiscretions and livingston 's , saying that clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused the legal system and his powers . </s><s> as livingston said in his statement thursday : `` these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and i have never been asked to testify under oath about them . '' </s><s> democrats hoped that livingston 's seemingly drastic action would wake up the house to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt republicans to reconsider the impeachment of clinton . </s><s> rep. paul kanjorski , d-pa. , said , `` we are now starting to offer up sacrificial lambs to whatever terrible disease this is . '' </s><s> in a stirring speech applauded even by some republicans , rep. dick gephardt of missouri , the democratic leader , praised livingston as a `` worthy , good and honorable man '' and said his resignation was a grave mistake . </s><s> `` it 's a terrible capitulation to the negative political forces that are consuming our political system and our country , '' gephardt said , adding that the events of the last few days showed `` life imitates farce . '' </s><s> `` we need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality , '' he said , urging his colleagues to `` step back from the abyss '' and reject resignation , impeachment and `` vicious self-righteousness .

clinton intends to re-establish his authority while still in office . </s><s> he has one great advantage : two-thirds of the american public continues to voice its approval of his political stewardship , whatever it thinks of him as a man . </s><s> the president will press hard , despite his much-reduced leverage , for a deal on censure . </s><s> indeed , in as fine a piece of political irony as one could ask for , he has already sought to enlist former sen. bob dole , the republican he defeated in 1996 , as an emissary to the senate majority . </s><s> the numbers are not unpromising : with the help of six republicans , the 45 democrats could end the trial at any time and pass a censure resolution that the house would surely take up . </s><s> there are enough republican moderates and sometime party-buckers to make that a plausible target . </s><s> but the republican leader in the senate , trent lott of mississippi , who has made his unwillingness to take the president 's word plainly evident in recent days , is determined to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement . </s><s> it is clear that clinton 's reputation has been stained forever , no matter what the senate does . </s><s> the spot will not out . </s><s> history will remember this man who so coveted a glowing legacy not as an impresario of economic growth , not as the moses who pointed the way to the 21st century , but as the second president ever to be impeached , if not as the first to be ousted . </s><s> that harsh word , `` impeachment , '' will cling to his name as surely as `` teapot dome '' clings to harding 's and `` depression '' to hoover 's . </s><s> but he is not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the political avalanche that was shaken loose by the disclosure of clinton 's sexual relationship with a former white house intern , monica lewinsky . </s><s> the republicans ' public support has shriveled to 40 percent in the new times/cbs news poll , its lowest level in 14 years , and it could go lower once the fact of impeachment sinks in . </s><s> journalists are seen by many as jackals , indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they may cause as long as they get the story , and none too concerned about accuracy . </s><s> in fact , the whole political culture of the 1990s , with its criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference to important national and international issues , has fallen into disrepute with ordinary americans . </s><s> the last week seemed to crystallize the long-term decline in political civility . </s><s> republicans called clinton a liar , even as he was committing american pilots to the skies over iraq , and democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching or a political coup d'etat . </s><s> bipartisanship may have been the biggest victim of all . </s><s> party lines on saturday 's rolls calls held as firm as leg irons . </s><s> almost all of the republicans who opposed impeachment did so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because of special political circumstances _ the democratic majority in rep. constance morella 's district in the maryland suburbs of washington , for example , and the gratitude of rep. peter king , r-n.y. , for clinton 's peacemaking in ireland . </s><s> it is hard to see who has emerged from it with reputation enhanced , except perhaps hillary rodham clinton , staunch in the face of deception . </s><s> if some of the threats and dire predictions uttered by house democrats in recent days are to be taken at face value , the nation is entering upon an era of bad feelings , the polar opposite of a second era of good feelings , similar to that of the 1820s , that clinton had hoped to preside over . </s><s> rep. tom sawyer , d-ohio , compared clinton on friday to sir thomas more , executed for treason in 1535 because of his religious beliefs . </s><s> he quoted more 's words as an admonition for today : `` what you have hunted me for is not my actions but for the thoughts of my heart . </s><s> it is a long road you have opened . </s><s> god help the statesmen who walk your road . '' </s><s> but amidst all the loose talk about permanent damage to this institution or that , remember : things change with startling speed in modern american politics , and the institutions of american government have proved extraordinarily resilient . </s><s> president nixon , it was almost universally agreed in 1974 , had weakened the american presidency for many decades to come . </s><s> nobody said that after eight years under ronald reagan , and that was only 15 years later .	livingston 's surprise resignation puts pressure on clinton to do likewise .	clinton impeachment uncertain as partisan politics prevail	clinton impeachment issue deepens capital 's profound sense of uncertainty	crisis extends beyond clinton , but political institutions will survive

representatives moved to impeach president william jefferson clinton for perjury on saturday and to call on the senate to try him , convict him and remove him from office . </s><s> but even before the vote , republicans pressed another line of attack , demanding clinton 's resignation . </s><s> rep. robert livingston , nominated for speaker last month by his party , startled the house when he announced he would not run for speaker and would resign from the house after 21 years of service . </s><s> he urged the president to `` heal the wounds that you have created . </s><s> you , sir , may resign your post . '' </s><s> angry democrats booed and shouted , `` you resign ! '' </s><s> livingston continued , `` i can only challenge you in such fashion if i am willing to heed my own words .

'' </s><s> then he bolted from the house chamber , nearly knocking reporters and members down . </s><s> ( the house voted 228-206 to approve the first article of impeachment , accusing clinton of committing perjury before a federal grand jury . </s><s> the vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. est , leaving the 42nd president to face trial in the senate on whether he should be removed from office . ) </s><s> clinton rejected the advice immediately . </s><s> his spokesman , joe lockhart , said , `` the president has no intention of resigning . '' </s><s> by calling on livingston to reconsider , the president argued more broadly against resignation under fire . </s><s> perhaps speaking to both cases , lockhart said , `` it would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction . '' </s><s> unless clinton changes course , this would be only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the republic , and the first since andrew johnson was acquitted in 1868 . </s><s> sen. trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , has insisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting . </s><s> but the senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal . </s><s> considering the degree of partisanship displayed saturday , assembling the two-thirds majority required under the constitution for conviction is most unlikely . </s><s> sixty-seven votes would be required , and there are only 55 republicans in the senate , along with 45 democrats . </s><s> four articles of impeachment before the house charged clinton with perjury in lying about his affair with monica lewinsky to a federal grand jury here on aug. 17 . </s><s> he was also charged with perjury in the paula jones sexual harassment suit , obstruction of justice and abuse of power . </s><s> the republican argument , over and over , was that clinton had lied in denying having sexual relations with ms. lewinsky . </s><s> rep. dick armey of texas , the majority leader , said , `` a nation of laws can not be ruled by a person who breaks the law . '' </s><s> rep. nancy johnson of connecticut said : `` there can be no justice without the truth . </s><s> that is just profoundly so , and that is why perjury matters . '' </s><s> rep. gerald kleczka of wisconsin began the democrats ' arguments by saying , `` what the president did was wrong , both personally and morally , but his acts did not threaten our democracy and thus do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as defined by our founding fathers in our constitution . '' </s><s> rep. charles schumer , new york 's senator-elect , said : `` the rule of law requires that the punishment fit the crime . </s><s> allow us to vote for censure . '' </s><s> saturday 's votes were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between congress and a president since richard m. nixon resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on aug. 9 , 1974 . </s><s> but while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at democratic headquarters in the watergate complex , this one began with a murky land deal in arkansas in 1978 . </s><s> through the efforts of kenneth starr , the independent counsel under the law enacted in the wake of watergate , the investigation spread to examine clinton 's affair with a white house intern . </s><s> all year it has preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnect with public opinion ; since the scandal became public in january , polls have shown that the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry brought to an end . </s><s> even on friday night , after a 13-hour debate , a cbs news poll of 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment ; 58 percent wanted a no vote . </s><s> the conflict now enters uncharted seas , since the nixon resignation cut the matter short and the johnson trial occurred in a different america , with no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls . </s><s> but the capital was still rife with confident speculation . </s><s> some guessed , or hoped , that the results of the recent poll , which showed increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the nation a trial in which ms. lewinsky and linda tripp would be star witnesses , would weaken clinton 's resolve . </s><s> others thought the republicans , seeing dismal numbers in polls about their party 's standing in the united states , would be the first to blink . </s><s> with a majority in the senate , they have the power to end a trial at any time after the senate receives notice of impeachment on the day it convenes , jan. 6 , or the next day . </s><s> but while clinton has focused on the polls , and the cbs news survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling of his job as president , resignation could almost immediately subject him to criminal prosecution . </s><s> and republicans have steadfastly ignored the polls all year , and confronted them directly on saturday . </s><s> representative j.c. watts of oklahoma , newly elected as chairman of the republican caucus , said : `` what 's popular is n't always right . </s><s> you say polls are against this . </s><s> polls measure changing feelings , not steadfast principle . </s><s> polls would have rejected the ten commandments . </s><s> polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women 's rights . </s><s> `` you say we must draw this to a close . </s><s> i say we must draw a line between right and wrong , not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen , but with the big fat lead of a no . </s><s> 2 pencil . </s><s> and we must do it so every kid in america can see it . </s><s> the point is not whether the president can prevail , but whether truth can prevail . '' </s><s> last weekend , when the judiciary committee recommended the four articles of impeachment , clinton 's side still hoped to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 republican moderates who were uncommitted . </s><s> as the week wore on , almost all of them broke against the president . </s><s> one who did not , rep. christopher shays of connecticut , said saturday : `` after judge starr 's report to congress in september , and his presentation to the judiciary committee in november , i concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven , and that the proven offenses were not impeachable . </s><s> `` but the president 's continued failure to come to grips with his actions , the sincerity and arguments of members of the judiciary committee from both sides of the aisle , the change of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally opposed impeachment and who now support it , and the strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who wanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position . '' </s><s> he added : `` yesterday morning , before i visited with the president , i concluded that my original position was the correct one , for me . </s><s> i believe that the impeachable offenses have not been proven , and that the proven offenses are not impeachable . '' </s><s> but rep. tom delay of texas , who has led the republican effort to force clinton from office , dismissed his and other arguments as moral relativism . </s><s> he began by praising livingston : `` there is no greater american in my mind , at least today , than bob livingston , because he understood what this debate was all about . </s><s> it was about honor and decency and integrity and the truth ; everything that we honor in this country . </s><s> it was also a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth . '' </s><s> he continued , `` the president 's defenders have said that the president is morally reprehensible , that he is reckless , that he has violated the trust of the american people , lessened their esteem for the office of president and dishonored the office which they have entrusted him , and that _ but that does n't rise to the level of impeachment . '' </s><s> rep. jose serrano of new york said , `` my constituents do n't hate bill clinton ; they love him and they 're praying for him right at this very moment . </s><s> you may have the votes today to impeach him , but you do n't have the american people . </s><s> and let me tell you something , i grew up in the public housing projects of the south bronx . </s><s> i can see a bunch of bullies when i see them . </s><s> the bullies get theirs , and you 're going to get yours , too . </s><s> rep. henry hyde of illinois , the judiciary committee chairman who brought the charges to the house floor , said the congress and the american people needed to distinguish between private acts of infidelity and public acts by public officials . </s><s> in clinton 's case , he said , the house was dealing with `` a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law-enforcement officer . '' </s><s> he said that the senate could be `` innovative and creative '' in deciding how best to punish clinton , but that the house was bound by the constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment . </s><s> `` justice is so important to the most humble among us , '' hyde said . </s><s> `` equal justice under the law _ that 's what we 're fighting for . '' </s><s> democrats , reading from the same constitution , voiced diametrically opposite conclusions , and attacked the fairness of the proceedings that culminated saturday . </s><s> `` we 're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes , '' said rep. jerrold nadler , d-n.y. `` we 're lowering the standards of impeachment . </s><s> what the president has done is not a great and dangerous offense to the republic . '' </s><s> democrats also criticized republicans for impeaching clinton at the very moment that u.s. troops waged war against iraq . </s><s> `` six days before christmas our troops are in battle , and a lame-duck congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in chief , '' said rep. david bonior of michigan , the second-ranking house democrat . </s><s> the ghosts of watergate hung over the house chamber . </s><s> one republican cited the parallels between the charges the house judiciary committee brought against nixon 25 years ago , and the counts that the same committee brought to the house floor for affirmation on saturday . </s><s> `` nixon cheated . </s><s> he cheated the electoral system , '' said rep. lindsey graham , a south carolina republican on the judiciary committee . </s><s> and now , graham said , the full house is voting to impeach clinton `` because we believe he committed crimes that result in cheating our judicial system . '' </s><s> but most of the day 's debate was firmly rooted in clinton 's effort to conceal his sexual affair with monica lewinsky . </s><s> rep. bob barr , a georgia republican on the judiciary committee who is one of clinton 's fiercest critics , held up copies of the u.s. criminal code , the judiciary committee 's report on the impeachment inquiry and , finally , the constitution , in defending his decision to impeach the president . </s><s> `` today , we rely on the three pillars of our society : the law itself , evidence and the constitution , '' said barr . </s><s> `` there is no joy in upholding the law , '' watts said . </s><s> `` if we can not see lawlessness , our children can not recognize it . </s><s> how can we tell our children honesty is the best policy when we do n't demand it as a policy ? '' </s><s> but democrats assailed the very premise on which the republican majority built its impeachment case against clinton . </s><s> rep. john conyers jr. of michigan , the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee , assailed the four articles of impeachment , count by count , as unfounded by evidence and failing to rise to impeachment . </s><s> he saved his most savage scorn for the final count , abuse of power . </s><s> `` the majority has simply tried to dress up the perjury counts in the watergate abuse-of-power language , '' conyers said .	house moves to impeach clinton for perjury ; calls on senate to try him .	livingston calls on clinton to follow his example and resign	house moves to impeach clinton for perjury and demands his resignation	clinton , impeachment , perjury , politics of personal destruction , nixon

us product	trade deficit rise  export china significantly  import explode	the commerce department on tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the american economy , reporting that the nation 's trade deficit widened by $ 2.2 billion in august to $ 16.77 billion . </s><s> that is the widest gap since the government recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992 . </s><s> it resulted from a decline in american exports and a sharp increase in what this country buys from abroad . </s><s> so far this year , the trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year 's levels and is up to a projected $ 170 billion for the year , a gap that is expected to widen even further . </s><s> one senior administration official who deals with economic issues , speaking on condition of anonymity , said tuesday that internal projections suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $ 300 billion , a figure that he said `` will certainly cut into growth , and could well become a major political problem . '' </s><s> trade deficits carry with them both good and troubling signals about the economy . </s><s> the current flood of imports is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest levels in decades . </s><s> and while sales of american aircraft , computer chips and other goods are suffering , the weakening of the dollar on world markets in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for american exporters . </s><s> but at this moment of global upheaval , the biggest problem facing american companies is the inability of many nations and some large companies in asia and latin america simply to borrow money to make ordinary purchases . </s><s> the result is such a freeze of economic activity that empty shipping containers are stacking up on american piers . </s><s> and the effects are hurting everyone from midwest farmers who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished russia , to east coast fishermen who are discovering that japan 's appetite for salmon and lobster has been ruined by the banking crisis . </s><s> among the most surprising elements of tuesday 's report is that more than a third of august 's deficit was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst effects of the global troubles : china . </s><s> despite continued growth of the chinese economy , exports to china have slowed dramatically and imports of chinese-made goods have exploded , as the country desperately seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in asia . </s><s> that increased the monthly deficit with beijing to $ 5.9 billion , levels previously only seen in trade with japan . </s><s> the chinese _ besieged by floods , deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient banking crisis _ have signaled to the united states in recent weeks that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets further in return for entry into the world trade organization . </s><s> that amounts to a major setback for president clinton , who for three years has been using the negotiations over china 's entry to the world body as the centerpiece of his effort to open china both economically and politically . </s><s> ostensible progress in this area has been cited by the administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration 's china policy , but now officials say privately that the progress is evaporating . </s><s> the decline in exports will trim the growth of the american economy , and it was one factor in the federal reserve 's decision to lower interest rates two times in recent weeks . </s><s> so administration officials were going out of their way tuesday to portray the numbers as another warning sign , but not a crisis . </s><s> `` while the united states remains strong and sound , the troubled condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence the u.s. trade balance , '' commerce secretary williams daley said in a statement tuesday . </s><s> after china , the biggest deterioration in the american trade balance in august came in mexico , where the peso has weakened markedly as economic contagion has spread through latin america . </s><s> exports to mexico have remained unchanged . </s><s> but imports from mexico have increased markedly _ chiefly automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment _ as american manufacturers have taken advantage of the weakening currency . </s><s> in contrast , america 's trade surplus with brazil , the latest focus of concern by the administration and the international monetary fund , barely budged from the same period a year ago . </s><s> normally , that would be cited as a sign of continued demand for american products in latin america 's largest economy , but there is fear it might be imperiled . </s><s> the news comes as the united states and the imf complete a bailout package of $ 30 billion or more for brazil , intended to help it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through asia , russia and several other nations . </s><s> tuesday the imf and brazil reached agreement on the country 's fiscal targets for this year and next , a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections in brazil this weekend . </s><s> but for all these potential problems , the rising trade deficit has barely caused a ripple on capitol hill . </s><s> because the rising level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment here , the subject has barely come up in races for the house and senate around the country . </s><s> the only exception has been in regions where the steel industry is strong . </s><s> the major steel companies have charged in recent weeks that asian nations are dumping products on the american market at prices well below their costs . </s><s> the commerce department has begun an inquiry . </s><s> the commerce department 's numbers showed that the deficit rose 15.3 percent to $ 16.77 billion in august , up from a revised figure of $ 14.55 billion in july . </s><s> the department said that the resumption of production at general motors corp. after last summer 's strike may have increased the size of the deficit 's rise in august , as gm brought in parts from abroad . </s><s> the deficit was the highest since the commerce department began a new method of tracking trade information in 1992 . </s><s> exports , the department said , fell three tenths of 1 percent , to about $ 74.8 billion . </s><s> imports rose 2.2 percent to $ 91.6 billion .	commerce dept .  measures effects of global economic downturn on

leaders _ dictators , unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies _ who it thinks can make an enormous contribution to peace , security or america 's agenda by taking early retirement , at a minimum . </s><s> in the 1950s , the leftist leaders of iran and guatamala made the top 10 , in the '60s it was populated by diem and sukarno and other southeast asians . </s><s> president richard m. nixon and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting in the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of salvador allende gossens in chile was to `` make the economy scream . '' </s><s> diplomatic etiquette , though , has usually discouraged shouting america 's enemies list from the white house rooftop . </s><s> after all , foreign policy is n't about personalities , right ? </s><s> but last week , driven by frustration , or anxiety , or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras , the clinton administration piped up , twice . </s><s> in very different situations , in opposite corners of the world , the united states spoke loudly because it ca n't find a stick . </s><s> sunday , hours after he called off an attack on iraq , clinton finally volunteered the obvious , that the focus of u.s. policy toward iraq is the removal of president saddam hussein _ what clinton called supporting the `` forces of change in iraq . '' </s><s> no matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably . </s><s> the bigger surprise came monday , when polite-to-a-fault al gore used his visit to malaysia for an asian economic summit meeting to throw u.s. support behind protesters calling for `` reformasi , '' the code word on the streets of kuala lumpur for dumping prime minister mahathir mohamed . </s><s> he has long been a burr in washington 's side , denouncing america , its currency traders and its jews . </s><s> he recently imprisoned his western-thinking finance minister , anwar ibrahim , who has suddenly become asia 's most visible jailed dissident . </s><s> but mahathir is no saddam , not by a long shot . </s><s> gore 's aides insist that his speech was a call for reform , not a demand that mahathir step down . </s><s> but it was n't interpreted that way . </s><s> the new zealanders called it `` megaphone diplomacy . '' </s><s> the malaysian government called it `` disgusting '' and an `` interference in internal affairs . '' </s><s> predictably , executives of several u.s. companies that have flocked to kuala lumpur told the malaysians that gore was rude , while assuring washington that he had uttered words that needed to be said . </s><s> whatever the wisdom of the gore 's words , they raised the question of what it takes these days for the world 's most powerful nation to begin publicly suggesting that it 's time for a nettlesome leader to go . </s><s> because there is no official list , there are no real criteria for getting on it . </s><s> some leaders mysteriously escape mention , like kim jong il of north korea . </s><s> president clinton is spending the weekend on the korean peninsula , staring across the demilitarized zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to break out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects , in return for billions in western energy aid . </s><s> yet washington has never called on the starving north koreans to revolt against kim 's repressive regime . </s><s> his government , taking a page out of the saddam playbook , suggested last week that if the united states really wants to look at a mountain tunnel that the pentagon believes is a nuclear installation in the making , it should write a check for another $ 300 million . </s><s> no one even called for kim 's removal when , a few months ago , he lobbed a three-stage missile over japan just to show he knew how . </s><s> `` the rules for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky , '' said richard feinberg , a professor at the university of california at san diego who served in the clinton administration 's first term . </s><s> `` when they really want to push someone out , it is because that country is part of a larger strategic concern at the time . </s><s> but the country itself usually does n't have great strategic weight '' _ it 's another matter to call for a change of leadership in beijing or moscow _ `` and it helps if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point to . '' </s><s> clinton 's call for saddam 's ouster last weekend created barely a ripple because , after all , he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler of anthrax and plutonium ( even if brent scowcroft , who was president george bush 's national security adviser , insisted last week that saddam nowadays is simply `` an irritant , an annoyance , a pest and a problem , but not a threat to the region at the moment '' ) . </s><s> mahathir , however , is far more complex case . </s><s> he 's a prime example of how opposing washington 's political and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move a leader from the list of authoritarians whom washington tolerates to the list of authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness . </s><s> like other asian strongmen _ ferdinand marcos of the philippines and suharto of indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear was that malaysia would become a communist domino . </s><s> but he also seemed eminently tolerable long after the cold war was over . </s><s> he has never been accused of enormous corruption . </s><s> he turned his country into a model of competitiveness , and malaysia became the exemplar of the `` big emerging markets '' that clinton 's commerce department touted until things went sour last year . </s><s> sure , he was always prickly . </s><s> but he is no terrorist or killer _ u.s. companies have flocked to his country , and say they want to stay _ and his iron control over political discourse is no stronger than in neighboring singapore . </s><s> just this summer , u.s. treasury secretary robert rubin paid him an ostensibly friendly , if strained , visit and made no reference to human rights . </s><s> that all changed when ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail . </s><s> he has long been an advocate of the western-style solutions to economic turmoil _ more openness , more freedom _ and the protest movement against mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail . </s><s> gore leapt on that opportunity _ particularly striking because , in the case of indonesia earlier this year , it took the administration months to come to the conclusion that president suharto had to go . </s><s> he went .	n. korea may have nukes , lobbed missile over japan ; no call for kim ousted ?	clinton says focus of policy toward iraq is removal of saddam hussein	contrary to harsh u.s. criticism of despots , kim jong li escapes mention	leaders of iraq and malaysia on us `` hit list '' : why not north korea 's kim ?

important that we not overreact here on the first day , '' clinton said in response to reports that iraq had balked at a request by u.n. inspectors for documents on its weapons program . </s><s> but , speaking at a joint appearance with south korean president kim dae jung , clinton called the requested documents `` quite important '' and said iraq had `` some affirmative obligations '' to help weapons inspectors . </s><s> aides to clinton denied that his comments represented any softening toward iraq . </s><s> they said that because the situation was still developing and the president was preparing for meetings with kim he had not been briefed in detail on iraq 's resistance when he appeared before reporters saturday . </s><s> national security adviser sandy berger said the administration was consulting with other members of the u.n. security council about the matter . </s><s> if iraq fails to meet its obligations under u.n. resolutions , he said , `` we obviously are

'' </s><s> the clinton administration is urgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in north korea that it believes may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant . </s><s> saturday , clinton called that site , together with north korea 's test firing in august of a missile over japan , `` cause for deep concern . '' </s><s> but the clinton administration is trying a very different approach toward north korea than toward iraq , partly at the urging of kim , who is pursuing a `` sunshine policy '' of engagement with the north . </s><s> as clinton and kim delivered prepared statements and answered questions saturday , clinton became most animated in describing what he called `` a very beautiful picture '' that he happened to spot after turning on his hotel television on arriving in seoul on friday night : film of a cruise ship recently permitted to carry south koreans on a tour into the north . </s><s> `` i ask the north koreans to think about this , '' he said , arguing that kim 's policy of engagement with the north presented them with a great opportunity . </s><s> `` nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would give the north koreans as much advantage , as much power , as much wealth , as much happiness as more of those ships going up there full of people from here . '' </s><s> the clinton administration fears that the construction site may be evidence that north korea has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the united states to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid . </s><s> the north koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapons . </s><s> but they have demanded that the united states pay $ 300 million to inspect it , a request rejected this week by a u.s. delegation to pyongyang , the north korean capital . </s><s> the new complex is being built on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of yongbyon , the former north korean nuclear research center . </s><s> kim continued saturday to emphasize his hopes for a new opening toward north korea . </s><s> but he said , `` we will not tolerate any possible attempt of north korea to proliferate nuclear weapons , missiles and other weapons of mass destruction . '' </s><s> the clinton administration plans to resume negotiating with north korea over inspecting the site in december . </s><s> in addition to strategies for easing the asian financial crisis , clinton discussed north korea during a visit to tokyo on thursday and friday . </s><s> the subject of north korea consumed most of his two hours of meetings with kim here saturday at the blue house , which contains the korean president 's office and home . </s><s> the administration has been criticized in congress and in this region for letting its policy on north korea drift , but clinton called that policy a `` clear-eyed mix '' of diplomacy and deterrence . </s><s> he said that so far the 1994 agreement had worked , because without it `` north korea already would have produced a sizable amount of weapons-grade plutonium . '' </s><s> under pressure from congressional critics , clinton last week appointed william perry , his former defense secretary , to review his policy on north korea . </s><s> on other matters , clinton declined to criticize the government of indonesia for using force to crack down on protesters there , saying that he did not `` have enough facts at this moment to give you the right answer . '' </s><s> but he said he hoped there would be `` no backsliding '' in indonesia . </s><s> clinton followed his appearance with kim with a visit to the national folk museum here , where he conducted an hourlong conversation with six korean academics , businessmen and union leaders about the troubled state of korea 's economy and its impact on the society . </s><s> he attended a state dinner saturday night , before stopping by a concert where his brother , roger , a musician , happened to be performing . </s><s> clinton repeatedly congratulated kim for his efforts at economic reform , noting that interest rates had fallen here and the currency had stabilized . </s><s> but he also pressed kim during their private meetings to restructure the five huge conglomerates , or chaebols , that account for some 40 percent of the korean economy . </s><s> in describing the leaders ' conversation , berger called restructuring the chaebols `` perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the south korean economy .

very kind personal things '' they had said to him , the president declared , `` if i had to do it all over again , every day , i would do it in a heartbeat , to see america where it is today as compared to six years ago . '' </s><s> as the applause died away , clinton continued , `` i want you to understand , too , that we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in life . '' </s><s> he added with a chuckle : `` most of us do n't have to live with it in quite such a public way . </s><s> but nobody gets out of life for free . '' </s><s> to the music of a saxophone and a hammered dulcimer , clinton raised about $ 200,000 over lunch in a private home in cleveland for the democratic senate candidate in ohio , mary boyle . </s><s> then he flew to philadelphia to raise half a million dollars for the democratic party . </s><s> by midsummer , the president 's aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing . </s><s> but as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached , his free-form remarks have become longer . </s><s> in cleveland on friday , he spoke for 26 minutes and here on friday evening he spoke for almost 20 minutes . </s><s> these fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since clinton 's videotaped grand jury testimony on aug. 17 . </s><s> he is lauded , applauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors . </s><s> `` mr. president , these are your friends here today , '' said tony george , the host of the cleveland event , offering the refrain of those who have played a similar role . </s><s> but in cleveland as elsewhere , protesters who were scattered along the president 's motorcade route were reminders of calls for his resignation and impeachment , and of the mockery some are heaping upon his presidency . </s><s> at a rally for the president outside city hall here friday night a group of teamsters chanted , `` two more years . '' </s><s> clinton 's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds of people , some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs . </s><s> after an impromptu shopping trip , during which he was greeted with shouts of `` we love you , '' clinton told some donors at the beginning of an impassioned reprise of his cleveland speech : `` i did n't even mind the protesters , that 's the american way . '' </s><s> but , he added , he preferred it when they were in the minority , `` and that seemed to be the case . '' </s><s> as he rode into cleveland , clinton passed a billboard for a local radio station , wncx . </s><s> `` lovin ' , touchin ' , squeezin ' , '' it read , the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with his arm over ms. lewinsky 's shoulders , the washington monument beside them . </s><s> the president left it to his aides on friday to respond directly to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in washington . </s><s> instead , in his remarks , clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency about addressing the international economic crisis and the needs of struggling farmers and schoolchildren . </s><s> as he typically does now before such partisan audiences , he also walked through his political calculation for the mid-term elections . </s><s> clinton said in cleveland that republicans had bragged privately to him about their prospects . </s><s> `` they tell me , `oh , we 're going to do very well , mr. president , in these mid-terms because we have so much more money than you do , ' '' and because democrats who turned out to re-elect clinton would not return to the polls in an off-year . </s><s> that argument , of course , would also insulate clinton from any blame for depressing the democratic vote . </s><s> but he often goes further than that , saying that his predicament could actually help the democrats . </s><s> lower-income democratic voters , he said , might not bother to vote in a typical election . </s><s> `` the people that were good enough to serve you here at this event today , they 've got a lot of hassles in their life , '' he said . </s><s> but , he said , `` adversity is our friend , '' because it can overcome apathy and `` focus us on what is at issue here . '' </s><s> what should be at issue , clinton said , are his achievements and agenda and the republicans ' record , which he described harshly . </s><s> he asked in cleveland . </s><s> `` they killed the minimum wage increase for 12 million americans . </s><s> they killed campaign finance reform . </s><s> they killed the tobacco reform legislation .

would have had little in common other than that they were democrats with relatively safe seats . </s><s> price is a centrist who has represented this high-tech district in north carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 years , a political scientist who has taught at duke and yale . </s><s> mrs. carson , fairly liberal , is a house freshman who worked her way up in politics from the grass roots , having been reared in poverty . </s><s> but party officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing the house are beginning to worry that democratic incumbents like price and mrs. carson share something else : greater-than-expected peril on election day . </s><s> as in many congressional races , the biggest variable is the white house scandal , which has injected fear and uncertainty into campaigns around the country . </s><s> other democratic incumbents who republican officials cite as locked in contests that are more competitive than expected include reps. corrine brown of florida , vic snyder of arkansas , lois capps and ellen tauscher of california , martin frost of texas , melvin watt of north carolina , john lafalce of new york and sander levin of michigan . </s><s> here in north carolina 's 4th congressional district , price , acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a tight race , said : `` this is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend . </s><s> it 's something you think about a lot in connection with the president 's troubles . '' </s><s> the efforts of price and mrs. carson to contain the lewinsky debacle _ and their opponents ' attempts to capitalize on it _ offer important clues suggesting how clinton 's problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country . </s><s> many democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure : they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them , and yet , sensing the possibility of a public backlash against republicans , they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon . </s><s> and while publicly these democrats express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them , their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote . </s><s> in a reflection of the uncertainty that the clinton scandal has cast even among republicans , the challengers in the price and carson districts _ both are political novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies : tom roberg , a computer executive in raleigh who is taking on price , has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal . </s><s> `` tom roberg has called for bill clinton 's resignation , '' the narrator says . </s><s> `` this is not the time to be silent , price . </s><s> where do you stand ? '' </s><s> but in indianapolis , gary hofmeister , a conservative jeweler challenging mrs. carson in indiana 's 10th congressional district , is taking a more subtle approach : rather than mention the scandal directly , he notes as often as he can that `` julia votes with clinton almost 100 percent of the time . '' </s><s> asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly , hofmeister said : `` do n't murder somebody when they 're in the process of committing suicide . </s><s> there would be a danger if we went overboard . '' </s><s> the best evidence of the discomfort of both price and mrs. carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would want clinton to campaign in their districts , both said it would be impossible at this late date for the white house to schedule a visit . </s><s> what if there was a sudden schedule change ? </s><s> both paused , squirmed a bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative . </s><s> `` given the president 's popularity , i doubt it will hurt me , '' mrs. carson said . </s><s> and price ? </s><s> `` i do n't think that would be such a good idea , '' he said . </s><s> `` i 've never had a president campaign here , and i would n't want to start this time '' although he is eagerly welcoming erskine bowles , the president 's chief of staff and a popular native son in north carolina , to stump with him here this sunday . ) </s><s> making strategy for the stump is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to democratic fears and republican hopes . </s><s> in three days of campaign stops here in north carolina and in indianapolis , the scandal was rarely raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party . </s><s> when a reporter asked about it , many voters said that as appalled as they were at clinton 's behavior , they had a hard time relating it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections in five weeks . </s><s> as hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside a gun and knife show at the indiana national guard armory in indianapolis last sunday , billy derringer , a 57-year-old machinist who is retired on disability , called him over to express outrage about the millions of dollars that had been spent to investigate clinton . </s><s> `` it 's pathetic to spend all of our money , '' said derringer , who identified himself as an independent . </s><s> `` it should n't have gotten this far . '' </s><s> hofmeister tried his best to make the republicans ' case . </s><s> `` there has to be rule of law , '' he said . </s><s> mrs. carson said she hoped that democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed up with the lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her . </s><s> to that end , she proudly informs audiences that she voted against making public the report delivered to the house by kenneth starr , the whitewater independent counsel . </s><s> `` i was one of 63 members of congress who voted against putting all that filth on the internet , '' she said , adding that starr 's inquiry had been `` a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability . '' </s><s> the carson campaign is counting on voters like timothy daly , a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a republican two years ago but now favors mrs. carson . </s><s> `` i 'm pulling the democratic ticket because i 'm tired of it : the right side of the republican party is playing politics , '' daly said . </s><s> `` we 'd like to see them go on with the people 's business . '' </s><s> back here in the 4th district , price has some reasons to be worried . </s><s> he was first elected to the house in 1986 but , as a four-term incumbent , was ousted in the republican sweep of 1994 ( only to win his seat back two years later ) . </s><s> in addition , the district was redrawn last year to include a large durham section where voters do not know him well . </s><s> determined not to be a midterm casualty of clinton once again , price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career . </s><s> rather than engage roberg over the clinton scandal , price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue : education . </s><s> the congressman 's advisers say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal . </s><s> but the price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve , in the event roberg appears to be riding the clinton scandal to advantage : the incumbent 's advisers say they would not be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science . </s><s> at a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of raleigh the other night , roberg opened his remarks by asserting that clinton had `` lost the moral authority to lead . '' </s><s> yet none of those assembled asked him about the scandal ; they were more concerned about the state 's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood .	democrat candidates try to contain effects of lewinsky debacle on campaigns	uncertainty over effect of white house scandal on congressional voting	democratic candidates assess effect of clinton scandal on pending elections	clinton scandal an unknown factor in congressional races

, d-n.y. , and thereby risked d'amato 's wrath . </s><s> the endorsement is risky , labor leaders acknowledge , because angering this powerful senator could make him far less responsive to labor 's needs when unions turn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected . </s><s> although it may seem illogical , two words go far to explain why rivera 's union backed schumer : monica lewinsky .

55 seats to the democrats ' 45 . </s><s> for labor leaders like rivera , the notion of a strong republican majority is a nightmare . </s><s> that fear has helped push other new york unions into

to survive into the next century , '' rivera said . </s><s> alarmed that the democrats will lose senate seats in california , illinois , wisconsin , nevada and south carolina , rivera 's union

senate	boyle tough senate race popular republican gov  voinovich	the last time george voinovich ran for office , he won re-election as ohio 's governor with 72 percent of the vote , stunning even his most optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory margins in ohio politics . </s><s> this year , voinovich , a republican who is barred from seeking a third term , is running again , this time for the senate seat held by john glenn , a democrat who is retiring . </s><s> and while there are few who expect voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four years ago , politicians of both parties generally acknowledge that he is well positioned to increase the republican majority in the senate . </s><s> that has not prevented voinovich 's democratic opponent , mary boyle , from undertaking a vigorous campaign . </s><s> ms. boyle , a former commissioner in cuyahoga county , which encompasses cleveland , is crisscrossing the nation 's seventh-most populous state in what she describes as a grass-roots campaign that , while operating on a comparative shoestring , has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known democrats _ president clinton foremost among them _ on the campaign trail . </s><s> glenn , the former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month at the age of 77 , has not made an endorsement in the senate race . </s><s> like many candidates this year , ms. boyle , 55 , is campaigning hard on the issue of education , seeking to portray voinovich , 61 , as a lackluster steward who allowed the state 's schools to decline . </s><s> `` he promised to be the education governor , '' said ms. boyle . </s><s> `` but after seven and a half years he has failed the students of this state . '' </s><s> her role in the campaign , she said , `` is to remind the people of the state of ohio that george voinovich made a promise and that he did n't deliver on it . '' </s><s> specifically , she discusses a decision last year by the ohio supreme court that cited wide disparities in the quality of the state 's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for funding them . </s><s> she has also attacked her republican opponent for supporting a proposal to raise the state 's sales tax by one percent . </s><s> under that plan , half the additional funds would have been used for school improvement with the remainder earmarked for reducing property taxes . </s><s> that statewide ballot initiative last may proved to be wildly unpopular , with about 80 percent of the voters opposing it . </s><s> while the topics of taxes and education are hot ones this political season in ohio , it is not clear that ms. boyle 's emphasis on them has helped her campaign . </s><s> despite some narrowing in the opinion polls , she is still trailing voinovich by 10 percentage points in some polls and as much as 18 points in others . </s><s> there is also a sharp fund-raising disparity . </s><s> ms. boyle , who is running her first statewide race and has widespread union support , has raised nearly $ 2 million so far , far less than the nearly $ 7 million voinovich has taken in . </s><s> also , voinovich , a former lieutenant governor , has been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and thus is the better-known candidate . </s><s> the electoral dynamics of ohio are also aiding voinovich . </s><s> the northern half of the state , with its history of industrial , unionized cities , has a tradition of voting largely for democratic candidates , while the southern tier of the state is considered more conservative and typically leans republican . </s><s> but voinovich and ms. boyle share the same home terrain , depriving ms. boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies democratic candidates . </s><s> indeed , as a boy , voinovich once delivered newspapers to the boyle home in the working-class collinwood section of cleveland . </s><s> and voinovich , a former mayor of cleveland , has developed a reputation as a moderate republican who works well with democrats . </s><s> voinovich , while campaigning vigorously himself , is keeping a full schedule of official duties , assuming the role of the experienced , elected official . </s><s> `` if i get into the senate , i will probably know more about domestic policy than any member of the senate , '' he said in an interview on wednesday in canton , sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum . </s><s> `` as mayor , i had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban america and was fairly successful in dealing with them . </s><s> and , as governor , i have dealt with the problems of medicaid , welfare and education . </s><s> i 'm the only person in the united states who has been president of the national league of cities and chairman of the national governors association . '' </s><s> to his opponent 's charges on his record on education , voinovich is dismissive . </s><s> `` i 'm probably the only republican in the united states who has been endorsed by the ohio education association and national education association , '' he said , adding that ms. boyle was a member of the state legislature during the period cited in the supreme court ruling . </s><s> `` mary boyle was vice chairman of the ways and means committee and a member of the democratic leadership during those years , '' voinovich said . </s><s> `` they did nothing to fix the buildings , they did nothing for technology and the urban school districts . '' </s><s> ms. boyle , who has not yet begun to run campaign commercials on television , said her status as the underdog had `` allowed me to be more focused , more intense . '' </s><s> pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former democratic sen. bill bradley of new jersey here on wednesday , ms. boyle said : `` this has been a marathon and it 's been pretty much uphill . </s><s> but now , we 're down to the last three miles . </s><s> it 's a tough race .

behind the times , the house voted friday to condemn the nazi-soviet nonaggression pact of 1939 . </s><s> the measure , a nonbinding resolution , was brought to the floor by rep. john shimkus , r-ill . </s><s> he is of lithuanian descent , has a pocket of lithuanians in his hometown of collinsville and wants to try to highlight his support for the baltic states ' past efforts against soviet repression . </s><s> shimkus ' measure is an example of how members of congress are spending their time as they stand idle and wait for republican leaders to reach agreement on spending bills with the white house , thus avoiding a government shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the november elections . </s><s> with time on their hands , many republicans are using the house floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that they can boast about to the folks back home . </s><s> most of these matters have little chance of finding their way into law , but members hope to turn them to their advantage on election day . </s><s> there are plenty of other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention . </s><s> these tend to be special-interest matters that members hope will escape scrutiny in the rush to leave town . </s><s> the sponsors of these measures now have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry , which has been preoccupying congress , the news media and the public and giving them cover to move their pet causes quietly into the gigantic omnibus package that congress will eventually present to clinton for signing . </s><s> these quieter measures include one proposed by mississippi 's two senators , trent lott and thad cochran , both republicans . </s><s> they want agriculture export credits to buy chickens for russia , which has bought the chickens but can not pay for them . </s><s> the chickens are from mississippi . </s><s> democrats have little influence in the republican-controlled congress . </s><s> but some democrats are close enough to republican leaders , and to republican goals , that their measures are taken seriously . </s><s> these include rep. john murtha , d-pa. , the ranking democrat on the national security subcommittee of the appropriations committee , who is pushing a measure to increase military pensions . </s><s> perhaps the best example of an attempt to force a vote for political advantage is a measure that would require minors to notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives from federally funded family planning clinics . </s><s> house leaders allowed the measure to be brought to the floor as a way to appease the more conservative members , who believe they have been shortchanged by the budget process . </s><s> it passed the house by a vote of 224-200 but has almost no chance of becoming law . </s><s> the senate does not plan to take it up , and clinton would almost certainly veto it . </s><s> but rep. tom coburn , r-okla. , said that votes like these were

new york senate race	gay lesbian group lobby support democrat new york senate race	human right campaign endorse damato ire democrat	white house officials and gay democrats , concerned that the nation 's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse sen. alfonse d'amato for re-election , are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the democratic challenger , rep. charles schumer . </s><s> publicly , officials in the organization , the human rights campaign , said they were still deliberating their position in the closely watched race , considered among the tightest in the nation . </s><s> they said they would probably make an endorsement by friday . </s><s> but privately , organization officials and gay activists from both parties who have been monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse d'amato , a republican seeking his fourth term . </s><s> they also raised the possibility that the group would endorse both candidates , or remain neutral . </s><s> if the group endorses d'amato , said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity , the endorsement would be based on three major factors : the group tends to favor incumbents , has been searching for allies among the senate republican majority and considers d'amato 's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong . </s><s> an endorsement by the group , which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters , could prove important in swinging voters to d'amato in a tight race . </s><s> it would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator , who has sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters . </s><s> a d'amato endorsement would also weaken schumer 's efforts to portray the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many voters a fraying of the traditional democratic coalition that has included black and gay voters , women and labor unions . </s><s> the intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance of the new york senate race to democrats across the nation , who see defeating d'amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the republicans from gaining 60 seats in the senate _ enough to stop a democratic filibuster . </s><s> the republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority . </s><s> `` there is sentiment in the community that if the republicans get 60 votes , that trent lott will basically be in charge politically for the next two years , '' said david mixner , a close friend of president clinton 's who is gay . </s><s> he was referring to the senate majority leader , who has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania . </s><s> saturday , schumer picked up his own endorsement from new york 's largest gay and lesbian political organization , the empire state pride agenda . </s><s> although the human rights campaign is bipartisan , it has been very close to the clinton administration , has many democrats on its board and receives much of its money from democratic contributors . </s><s> largely because of the group 's strong democratic ties , gay democrats , new york liberals and white house officials are infuriated that it is even considering endorsing d'amato , who also runs on the right to life and conservative party lines and often receives high ratings from the christian coalition , which typically opposes legislation on civil rights for gay people . </s><s> although the organization has been thought to be inching toward a d'amato endorsement for months , the lobbying campaign for schumer has picked up intensity in the last two weeks , driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer than ever . </s><s> democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for gay people said that vice president al gore , hillary rodham clinton and secretary for health and human services donna shalala have made personal appeals to human rights campaign officials urging them not to endorse d'amato . </s><s> white house officials said they did not know whether the three had made such appeals , and human rights campaign officials declined to comment . </s><s> schumer met privately with the group 's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement . </s><s> clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing the group 's board members at every opportunity , from cocktail parties to fund-raisers , raising concerns about a d'amato endorsement . </s><s> some new york advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls , e-mail messages and letters . </s><s> democratic officials have been encouraging the group 's major donors to express their opposition to d'amato . </s><s> people involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best , they are hoping the group will endorse both candidates , or make no endorsement at all . </s><s> `` chuck schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are important to gay communities , '' said a senior white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity . </s><s> `` the last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so supportive of their agenda . '' </s><s> the human rights campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in washington , with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $ 13 million . </s><s> the group was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the christian right and ronald reagan . </s><s> paradoxically , d'amato was first elected in the reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong supporter of president reagan . </s><s> for d'amato , who has aggressively courted gay voters , the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate . </s><s> since 1993 , the senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military , sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers and opposed his own leadership 's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the clinton administration . </s><s> to gay supporters of d'amato , an endorsement by the human rights campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close to the democratic party . </s><s> those who support a d'amato endorsement , including top officials within the human rights campaign , contend that in the current political climate , where congress is almost certain to remain under republican control after november , gay people must build alliances with moderate republicans . </s><s> human rights campaign officials also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents , even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues . </s><s> that is the case in new york , where schumer 's rating by the human rights campaign has been consistently better than d'amato 's . </s><s> both men , however , have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages . </s><s> in a precedent widely cited by d'amato supporters , the organization endorsed sen. john f. kerry , a democrat , over the republican challenger , william weld , in the 1996 massachusetts senate race , even though weld 's record on gay rights was considered stronger . </s><s> the move angered gay republicans , who now contend that snubbing d'amato would prove that the group is biased toward democrats . </s><s> but there is clearly a large number of human rights campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing d'amato will permanently damage the group , particularly among women . </s><s> they fear that abortion rights supporters will quit the group in droves because d'amato has never wavered in his opposition to abortion during 18 years in congress . </s><s> many new york gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses d'amato , whom they blame for installing the state senate majority leader , joseph bruno , whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay . </s><s> matt foreman , executive director of the empire state pride agenda , cited d'amato 's role as `` the architect '' of the state republican party as a major reason the group endorsed schumer . </s><s> `` while he has criticized fellow republicans in washington for their intolerance , here at home , his own party 's blatant discrimination is still the order of the day , '' foreman said . </s><s> for that reason , some white house officials say they think a human rights campaign endorsement of d'amato will be almost meaningless among gay voters . </s><s> they contend that it might even hurt the senator among his conservative base . </s><s> `` i do n't think anybody will vote for al d'amato because of an hrc endorsement , '' said a white house aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity . </s><s> `` but i think some people in the right to life party and some upstate people are going to say , `who is this guy and why should we vote for him ?

delijaj clan civilian heavy loss	vengeful serbs massacre 21 civilian delijaj clan kosovo	some of the closest combat in the half year of the kosovo conflict , to the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor , occurred near this village six weeks ago , in the days before 21 women , children and elderly members of the delijaj clan were massacred by serbian forces , their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor . </s><s> piecing together what happened , from surviving family members , ethnic albanian separatist forces and official serbian information , a story emerges of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by serbian tanks , artillery and infantry . </s><s> the serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered unusually heavy losses and , after the guerrillas finally fled , took revenge against the civilians , shooting women and children at close range as they tried to run away from their pursuers . </s><s> according to relatives who found the bodies , pajazit delijaj , 65 , was decapitated , his brain left on display on the ground . </s><s> hava delijaj , 65 , was shot and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of skin . </s><s> young women and children who had run a few hundred yards up a rocky path were mowed down . </s><s> miraculously , a 6-week-old baby , diturie , was found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother , lumnije , 30 , more than 24 hours after the killings . </s><s> `` blood was in her mouth and her mother 's hand on the baby , '' said imer delijaj , the father , an avowed member of the kosovo liberation army , the ethnic albanian guerrilla force , who returned in uniform to discover the bodies . </s><s> `` i moved her hand and at that moment she opened her eyes . </s><s> i realized she was alive . </s><s> i tried to clean the blood from her mouth and she put her tongue out . '' </s><s> several members of the delijaj clan survived . </s><s> zejnije delijaj , 39 , who had cooked for the guerrillas at the family compound when they returned from fighting in the days before the massacre , recalled how she fled , crawling , falling , running and hiding in the woods as the serbs shot at her . </s><s> `` i could feel the dirt hitting me from the impact of the bullets , '' she said in an interview , her nose still bloodied from what she said was a heavy fall during her flight . </s><s> `` first it was machine guns , then grenades , then cannon , '' she said . </s><s> `` every time i moved and they heard leaves rustling , they shot . '' </s><s> the massacre of the delijajs , whose forebears settled in the drenica valley about 150 years ago , was not the first in the conflict that ravaged the serbian province between march and october and has now lulled into an uneasy truce . </s><s> indeed , the conflict between serbian forces bent on keeping kosovo in serbia and guerrillas fighting for the independence of its heavily ethnic albanian population first drew international attention with the massacre of the jasari clan in early march by serbian units at prekaz , in central kosovo . </s><s> but the killing of the delijajs , ranging from the paralyzed patriarch , fazli , 94 , who was burned in his bed , to the slaughter of valmir , 18 months , who was found shot , is the most thoroughly documented so far . </s><s> human rights watch , a new york-based group , believes the knowledge gathered so far increases the possibility of prosecutions by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands . </s><s> the hague 's prosecutors could also draw on the observations of diplomats , human rights monitors and reporters who saw the bodies scattered in the ravine where the victims were killed before they were buried in shallow graves in the clan 's nearby compound . </s><s> in other kosovo massacres , bodies had been moved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers . </s><s> further , family members who survived the assault have described what they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around obrinje as the serbs pushed forward early saturday morning , sept. 26 , from their headquarters at likovac , north of here . </s><s> by then , the albanian guerrillas had fled the area around the delijaj compound , dispersing after what a senior commander of the kosovo liberation army , naim maloku , termed particularly fierce combat with the serbs . </s><s> in the days before sept. 26 , he said , the guerrillas _ caught in a serbian pincer movement _ had decided to fight rather than surrender . </s><s> the fighting _ sometimes house to house , even room to room _ took an unusually heavy toll among the serbs , said maloku , a former officer in the yugoslav army . </s><s> he said he believed that it was those deaths the serbs avenged with the massacre of the delijajs . </s><s> in other major attacks during the conflict , the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch . </s><s> in obrinje , led by another former officer of the yugoslav army whom maloku declined to name , the guerrillas fought , using land mines and rocket-propelled grenades . </s><s> maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters that at least 47 serbian soldiers and police officers were killed in the fighting between here and bajince , three miles east . </s><s> `` we took weapons from 47 serbs , '' he said . </s><s> the state-controlled serbian media center in kosovo 's capital , pristina , said 10 serbian police officers were killed in the fighting , including five reservists who died when their vehicle hit an antitank mine on sept. 25 . </s><s> the announcement of 10 serbs killed in one action is unusually high . </s><s> the practice of taking violent revenge is a time-honored tradition in the balkans . </s><s> from 1991 to 1995 , in the wars in croatia and bosnia , serbs , croats and , to a far lesser extent , the main victims , the muslims , avenged world war ii massacres and new blood feuds , driven into killing by leaders who exploited old conflicts to carve new fiefs for themselves as the old , communist yugoslavia collapsed . </s><s> in this case , it appears , serbian vengeance was visited upon the delijajs . </s><s> survivors of the clan said they had feared an assault on their collection of mud and brick homes lining a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of likovac , the serbs ' base just a mile away . </s><s> the serbs had pushed the rebels out of likovac in august and the guerrillas had established new headquarters around bajince , six miles east of obrinje . </s><s> as the serbs swept down from the nearby cicavica mountains , and up from the road that runs from pristina to klina , it was clear that obrinje would be a target . </s><s> most women and children in the area had moved into apple valley , where more than 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors , seeking safety in numbers . </s><s> but imer delijaj , 38 , said he decided that the ravine below his family compound would be a better hiding place . </s><s> he said he believed the women , children and elderly would be spared if the serbs found them . </s><s> as the serbs approached on foot the saturday morning of the massacre , the last person to flee the compound itself was bashkim delijaj , 21 , the youngest son of 94-year-old fazli . </s><s> bashkim delijaj said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father . </s><s> `` the shelling started again at 7 a.m. on saturday and i saw a tank convoy approaching , with infantry behind the tanks , '' bashkim delijaj recalled in an interview . </s><s> `` i was smoking a cigarette when a grenade fell on the roof and from a hole in the gate i saw soldiers coming from about 30 meters away . </s><s> they were in brown army uniforms , had huge knives or small axes . </s><s> many had beards . '' </s><s> bashkim delijaj said he was unable to carry his father to safety , and did not have the courage to tell him what was happening . </s><s> `` i told him i was getting the animals out of the barn , '' he said . </s><s> he said he ran , hid , ran some more , and eventually received shelter from a farmer , all the time hearing shooting and shelling . </s><s> when the firing had died down monday morning , he returned to the compound and ran into imer , still wearing his guerrilla uniform . </s><s> they went to one of the houses and found imer delijaj 's brother , adem , 33 , shot dead , his body sprawled on the ground in the rain , and the burned torso of fazli . </s><s> `` i looked in the window of our house and saw only the bones of my father , which looked like what we learned in biology class , '' he said . </s><s> together , the two men went to find out what had happened in the ravine . </s><s> there they found the bodies . </s><s> first , ali , 65 , who , imer delijaj said , had been cut through the neck with his own tobacco cutting knife . </s><s> then pajazit , who had been decapitated in a makeshift tent , his brain placed between two foam mattresses . </s><s> then hava , 65 , who was sprawled near the tent . </s><s> they moved on to find jeton , imer 's 10-year-old son , and imer 's mother , hamide , 60 , not far away . </s><s> imer 's sister-in-law , luljeta , who was seven months pregnant , had been mutilated , he said . </s><s> a little further up the ravine , imer said he saw his wife , lumnije , 30 . </s><s> he opened his wife 's coat and found his 6-week-old baby girl , now 3 months old and recovering at a relative 's home in likovac . </s><s> he said he tried to clean the baby and then put her under his jacket and walked a few feet further to find the bodies of his 4-year-old daughter , menduhije , and two other young children , donieta , 5 , and gentiana , 7 . </s><s> the corpses of other family members were found in the woods and two older men , habib , 51 , and hysen , 53 , were found the next morning , imer said . </s><s> on oct. 3 , the bodies of two missing teen-age girls , mehane , 16 , and antigua , 13 , were found in the bushes at the side of a road near an abandoned serbian police compound . </s><s> later in the month , the body of hajriz was found pushed down a well , close to the ravine . </s><s> one uncle , sharif , who was in the ravine , is still missing , presumed dead . </s><s> human rights watch , which has been documenting the delijaj massacre , has described it as the most vicious of a pattern of attacks on civilians by the serbs in the kosovo conflict . </s><s> ( to a lesser extent , albanian guerrillas also attacked serbian civilians , forcing them from their homes , and allegedly carried out at least two massacres . ) </s><s> the evidence strongly indicates that the gornje obrinje killings were followed by conscious mutilations carried out after the victims were killed , a coming report by human rights watch says . </s><s> delijaj family members have told human rights watch monitors and others that they saw an ethnic albanian police officer accompanying the serbian police officers during the fighting . </s><s> they believe that the police officer , who is posted at the nearby glogovac police station , was used by the serbian special police officers as a guide to the obrinje area . </s><s> this police officer , who is apparently one of a small group of ethnic albanians officers who have remained loyal to the serbs , could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the war-crimes tribunal in the hague , according to human rights experts . </s><s> `` the ethnic albanian policeman could be an important witness to identifying the police and army units responsible for the atrocities , '' said peter boueckhart , a researcher for human rights watch . </s><s> `` it is vital that those who carried out these atrocities are prosecuted by the hague tribunal . '' </s><s> at the burned delijaj compound in the last week , imer delijaj has been acting as the host of a wake which , following albanian tradition , will last several weeks and began after family members returned from their hiding places in the woods . </s><s> color photographs of the youngest members of the family , and of imer 's mother and grandmother , have been mounted behind glass on a table outside the gate . </s><s> a 30-year-old faded black and white picture of fazli in a double-breasted suit stands apart , a sign of ultimate respect . </s><s> an outsized albanian flag with a black double-headed eagle on a red field is draped behind the table . </s><s> imer delijaj 's face seemed tense and his words were spare as he described his family 's death . </s><s> he did not express direct remorse for allowing his family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound , which for all practical purposes was an informal base for fighters . </s><s> his lawyer , bajram krasniqi , who said he was eager to be helpful to investigators of the hague tribunal , said in pristina that he believed imer delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision . </s><s> whether the tribunal will closely examine the case remains unclear . </s><s> slobodan milosevic , the yugoslav president , has issued only a handful of visas to investigators from the tribunal . </s><s> two investigators who were in kosovo at the time of the massacre left six days later without visiting the site or contacting krasniqi about the killings . </s><s> would imer delijaj seek revenge ? </s><s> as he sat on the floor of his living room with a group of male visitors , he replied : `` it 's easy to answer . </s><s> if i can see eye to eye with men i will fight them . </s><s> but only with men in uniform and in a fair fight . </s><s> if i see children with them , i will treat them like children all over the world . </s><s> children are children .

week before u.s. president bill clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new israeli-palestinian peace accord , the two sides exchanged angry accusations sunday over jewish settlements and street clashes . </s><s> ahmed qureia , speaker of the palestinian parliament , warned of possible violence if israel continues to expand settlements in the west bank and gaza strip , where the palestinians hope to establish a state . </s><s> `` if settlement activity continues , then all means of resistance are open , '' qureia , who is also known as abu ala , told reporters in the west bank town of ramallah . </s><s> since the signing of a land-for-security accord , jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift communities on west bank hilltops , in an explicit bid to keep the land from being turned over to the palestinians . </s><s> meanwhile , at a meeting of the israeli cabinet , ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak of street clashes between palestinian demonstrators and israeli troops in the west bank . </s><s> `` the palestinians have been asked to immediately stop the violence and incitement to violence , '' the cabinet said in a statement . </s><s> at least two palestinians were injured sunday in a confrontation outside the jewish settlement of ariel in the northern west bank . </s><s> demonstrators threw stones at israeli troops , who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas . </s><s> a day earlier , 27 palestinians and three israeli soldiers were injured in similar clashes throughout the west bank . </s><s> and three days before that , israelis were horrified by television footage of an israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten with chunks of concrete by a palestinian mob . </s><s> israel says yasser arafat 's palestinian authority is orchestrating the street fighting . </s><s> the palestinians deny that . </s><s> the past week 's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter dispute over palestinian prisoners held by israel . </s><s> israel last month freed 250 of 750 prisoners it is to release under the wye accords , but most were criminals . </s><s> the palestinians are demanding that so-called security prisoners _ those being held for anti-israel activity _ be released instead . </s><s> also sunday , another quarrel was brewing over the scheduled meeting of the palestinian national council , the palestinian parliament-in-exile , in the gaza strip during clinton 's visit . </s><s> at the gathering , the pnc and other palestinians in attendance are to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that call for israel 's destruction . </s><s> israel has demanded that the palestinians hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply

to gaza following a trip to europe . </s><s> clinton 's visit to israel and the palestinian lands , which is to begin saturday , is meant to provide impetus to the u.s.-brokered peace accords and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for compliance . </s><s> but some commentators suggested the visit was proving a polarizing force instead . </s><s> `` he is coming to promote the peace

was toppled from power . </s><s> the collapse of his government after two and a half years , the second-longest tenure since world war ii , suggested that the chronic political instability that marked italy for decades had sprung back to life . </s><s> though obliged to tender his resignation , prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed . </s><s> he may get a second chance to form a new majority , but even if he does , negotiations to that end could take days and even weeks , clouding decisions on such urgent issues as the crisis in kosovo . </s><s> nato military planners preparing for possible air strikes against yugoslavia had expected to use key air bases in italy . </s><s> in his weakened position , prodi will have difficulty persuading parliament to approve nato strikes . </s><s> he will have similar problems passing the 1999 budget , which is necessary before italy can cut its lending rates , a requirement for joining the single european monetary unit , the euro , on jan. 1 . </s><s> immediately after friday 's vote of 313-312 , in a tense and at times raucous session , prodi met with president oscar luigi scalfaro to submit his resignation and discuss his options . </s><s> in the coming days scalfaro will consult with dozens of other leaders to ascertain whether prodi has enough lingering support to try to form a new government . </s><s> if not , the president is expected to turn to another political leader . </s><s> if no compromise is found , italy could be plunged into early elections . </s><s> but parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to push things that far , for opinion polls suggest that voters are no more enamored of the center-right opposition parties than they are of the governing majority . </s><s> prodi , an economist , is admired by his western allies as a down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame italy 's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge . </s><s> by raising taxes , lowering interest rates and reducing the deficit , italy met the requirements for membership in the euro last spring , a feat that only a year before was considered impossible by german and french economists . </s><s> prodi was helped by a healthy global economy and a rare consensus among industrialists , labor unions and taxpayers , who feared that exclusion from the euro would condemn italy to third world status . </s><s> but his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform of a political system that is inherently fragile . </s><s> there are more than 40 parties in italy , and the government 's efforts to amend the constitution to introduce a two-party system failed . </s><s> `` unless the italian political system changes , italy is condemned to political instability , '' said sergio romano , a former diplomat and political science professor . </s><s> `` the country needs stability and credibility , and that will never happen as long as the government is hanging from a thread . '' </s><s> in 1996 prodi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left factions mostly made up of catholic moderates and leftists . </s><s> he relied on a fringe marxist group , the communist refounding party , for a majority in the lower house . </s><s> and that alliance , fragile from the beginning , finally frayed to the breaking point this week . </s><s> the hard-line leader of communist refounding , fausto bertinotti , said his party would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact with the center-left coalition . </s><s> that position drove the moderate wing of communist refounding , worried that a vote against prodi would open the doors to a center-right government , to split away . </s><s> but the 20-odd deputies who defied bertinotti were not enough to squeeze prodi through . </s><s> `` i am not bitter , '' prodi said moments after his defeat . </s><s> `` even today i received a lot of support . '' </s><s> in the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own , a member of the coalition . </s><s> `` they have won by the treachery of one single person , '' sergio mattarella , a deputy in prodi 's coalition , angrily told reporters , referring to silvio liotta , a member of the italian renewal party . </s><s> foreign minister lamberto dini , who heads that party , said liotta would be expelled . </s><s> prodi has often said he would not govern with any other majority than the center-left one that elected him in 1996 . </s><s> but throughout his tenure , he was forced to seek temporary alliances to push through major policy decisions . </s><s> he struggled to the last to try to keep his original majority intact . </s><s> on thursday , in an effort to woo more moderate communists to his side , the prime minister , a staunch ally of the united states , warned that he would oppose a nato strike aimed at stopping serbian violence in kosovo unless the u.n. security council approved the attack . </s><s> washington maintains that nato does not need a new u.n. resolution to order a strike .	prodi loses confidence vote ; will stay as caretaker until new government .	italian premier loses confidence vote and falls from power	confidence vote lost by 1 .  instability clouds nato cooperation on kosovo .	romano prodi loses confidence vote in parliament , 313-312

common contract hit  fingerpointing	galina starovoitova s murder may watershed event russian politics	in modern russia , the crime was so common as to be mundane . </s><s> two thugs , armed with machine pistols and silencers , stalked and killed a powerful figure , then slipped away into the night . </s><s> police vowed to catch them and politicians expressed outrage . </s><s> usually , that would be the end of the story . </s><s> this time , though , the figure shot was one of the most prominent and popular women in russian politics , a prospective presidential candidate with friends in the highest reaches of the kremlin . </s><s> as outrage mounted sunday , it seemed clear that the killing of galina starovoitova was not going to be treated as a routine crime , and some said it might turn out to be a watershed event in russian politics . </s><s> `` this is impossible to tolerate any longer , '' said grigory yavlinsky , the leader of yabloko , another reform-oriented party . </s><s> `` we must stop feeling powerless before the increasingly cheeky scum . </s><s> we can not go on living as though everything is running as usual . '' </s><s> starovoitova , a member of parliament and a leader of the liberal russia 's democratic choice party , was walking up the stairs of her apartment building in st. petersburg with a young aide friday evening . </s><s> a team of assailants _ police believe it was a man and a woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire . </s><s> starovoitova , shot three times in the head , collapsed and died instantly , authorities said . </s><s> the aide , 27-year-old ruslan linkov , was critically wounded , but managed to telephone a news agency reporter before losing consciousness . </s><s> police have recovered two guns , and are hoping that linkov can provide a description of the killers . </s><s> he had regained consciousness but still could not speak sunday . </s><s> although it was still not clear who killed starovoitova or why , the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract hit _ a remarkably common crime in post-soviet russia . </s><s> most of the killings involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped the government and the economy . </s><s> until now , the most notorious of the killings was that of popular television host vladislav litsyev , who was shot outside his moscow home in 1995 . </s><s> but there have been hundreds of others . </s><s> st. petersburg has been especially plagued . </s><s> last year , the city 's deputy governor was gunned down on a central st. petersburg street . </s><s> in the past two months alone , hitmen have claimed the lives of a legislative aide , a high-ranking city official and a prominent banker . </s><s> so deeply has the toxin infected russian society that president boris yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that his federal security service _ the domestic successor to the kgb _ had ordered the death of boris berezovsky , the nation 's most prominent businessman and the head of the commonwealth of independent states . </s><s> there is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an assassination of berezovsky . </s><s> but yeltsin 's order was the equivalent of u.s. president bill clinton ordering an investigation into whether the fbi was plotting to kill microsoft chairman bill gates . </s><s> yet , as remarkable as that news was , it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of starovoitova . </s><s> television news since her death has carried reports of little else . </s><s> reaction has poured in from virtually every important figure in the country , and from surrounding nations . </s><s> yeltsin , calling her `` my comrade , '' declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her death . </s><s> there was , in much of the reaction to starovoitova 's death , the sense that a line had been crossed . </s><s> perhaps it was because she was a woman , perhaps because she elicited impassioned support , or perhaps because people are simply fed up . </s><s> but , in more characteristic fashion , her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing . </s><s> colleagues of starovoitova declared _ without any apparent evidence _ that her communist foes in the duma , the lower house of parliament , were the most likely culprits in her death . </s><s> historian dmitry likachyov , one of the nation 's most revered and trusted figures , said her killing seemed to signal the `` outburst of a new red terror . '' </s><s> by late saturday , the name-calling had gone so far that interior minister sergei stepashin called a news conference to say there was no evidence that the communist speaker of the duma , gennady seleznyov , was involved in the killing . </s><s> seleznyov went on television to say he was saddened by her death . </s><s> `` but , '' he added , `` i would not like the deputies who sat on the same bench with galina starovoitova in the state duma ... to turn this into a political show . '' </s><s> it is too early to know where the recriminations and political maneuvering will lead . </s><s> for now , the only thing certain is the starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of russian martyrs .	starovoitova 's killing may be watershed event ; police have some evidence .	outrage at killing .  100s of others .  yeltsin overseeing investigation .	russians outraged at death of leader ; common contract hit ?  finger-pointing .	galina starovoitova 's murder may be a watershed event in russian politics

release of the document is a milestone in south africa 's transformation from white minority rule to democracy . </s><s> the commission , which has the power to grant amnesty , was tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and why of apartheid-era atrocities . </s><s> with the anc now in power and facing an election in mid-1999 , a condemnation by the commission could prove damaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing . </s><s> there has been no doubt that the report 's overwhelming blame would be laid on white governments and their security forces during the years under scrutiny , 1960-1994 . </s><s> indeed , news reports monday said the truth commission would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the anc and the more radical pan africanist congress were conducting a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state . </s><s> but in preliminary findings sent to the parties last month , the commission also said the two movements were `` morally and politically accountable '' for gross rights violations , south african press association and south african broadcasting corp. said . </s><s> the preliminary finding said that despite anc policy against killing civilians , the line between military and civilian targets had been blurred , sapa said . </s><s> it condemned the planting of landmines in rural areas , the execution of enemy agents , torture and mistreatment of anc members in its exile camps and for killing political opponents . </s><s> it said the party must accept responsibility for the activities of anc women 's league president winnie madikizela-mandela , nelson mandela 's former wife , and her mandela united football club , accused of killings , torture and kidnappings . </s><s> the commission also said the pac was guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaimed by blacks . </s><s> justice minister dullah omar , meeting journalists in pretoria , would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the anc . </s><s> `` i do expect various responses ( to the report ) . </s><s> i do not expect everyone to agree . </s><s> it will lead to healthy debate , '' he said . </s><s> he said that if the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses , it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether to proceed . </s><s> the director is appointed by the government . </s><s> the commission 's work is designed `` to help us establish the rule of law in south africa , and to establish the principle of accountability , '' omar said . </s><s> the anc already has prepared the ground for a negative finding , saying weeks ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgments were in the offing . </s><s> the anc was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners earlier this month . </s><s> the panel refused , to avoid appearing biased . </s><s> on monday , it rejected `` with contempt '' suggestions anc officials themselves had leaked the findings . </s><s> constand viljoen , leader of the tiny right-wing

the end of south africa 's white supremacist government and shared the 1993 nobel peace prize with president nelson mandela for that work , had objected to a finding by the commission that he was ``

predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law-enforcement agencies . </s><s> moreover , the south african state in the period from the late 1970 's to early 1990 's became involved in activities of a criminal nature when , amongst other things , it knowingly planned , undertook , condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts , including the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and others , inside and outside south africa . </s><s> in pursuit of these unlawful activities , the state acted in collusion with certain other political groupings , most notably the inkatha freedom party ( i.f.p . ) . </s><s> certain members of the state security council ( the state president , minister of defense , minister of law and order , and heads of security forces ) did foresee that the use of words such as `` take out , '' `` wipe out , '' `` eradicate , '' and `` eliminate '' would result in the killing of political opponents . </s><s> they are therefore responsible for deliberate planning which caused gross violations of human rights . </s><s> p.w . </s><s> botha during the period that he presided as head of state ( 1978-1989 ) according to submissions made to and findings made by the commission , gross violations of human rights and other unlawful acts were perpetrated on a wide scale by members of the south african defense force , including : the deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of persons opposed to the policies of the government , within and outside south africa . </s><s> the widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill treatment against such persons . </s><s> the forcible abduction of such persons where were resident in neighboring countries . </s><s> covert logistical and financial assistance to organizations opposed to the ideology of the a.n.c . </s><s> and other liberation movements . </s><s> inkatha the commission finds that in 1986 ,

report	commission offer amnesty confession  otherwise prosecution	south african may favor amnesty forego politically divisive trial	south african report  justice amnesty  forgive  go forward	the deal that south africa 's truth and reconciliation commission offered was simple enough : confess your crimes , apply for amnesty and you will go free . </s><s> if you do n't come forward , you will be prosecuted . </s><s> after more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities , the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty . </s><s> so the prosecutions should begin soon , right ? </s><s> not so fast . </s><s> the study was barely in the hands of president nelson mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun . </s><s> it seems that nearly all of south africa 's political parties _ including the ruling african national congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report . </s><s> suddenly , there is lots of talk about how the country ca n't withstand a round of politically divisive trials , and many political analysts here are betting that an agreement `` of mutual benefit '' is in the offing . </s><s> already , three major political parties are calling for some kind of new amnesty , and the anc is n't closing the door . </s><s> anc spokesman thabo masebe said it was `` premature '' to talk of a general amnesty , but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black south africans against other blacks that littered the kwazulu/natal province with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s . </s><s> in choosing a truth commission rather than a nuremberg-style trial with which to close out its brutal past , south africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation . </s><s> people would come clean and receive true forgiveness . </s><s> society would then be able to move on , its wounds cleansed and healed . </s><s> it was a model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past . </s><s> but given the chance , hundreds of south africa 's perpetrators did not come forward . </s><s> commission officials themselves say they were frustrated by the lack of cooperation , however exhaustive their report may seem . </s><s> it is perhaps too late , however , to press for more . </s><s> today 's south africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment , crime , white flight , too few schools and hospitals . </s><s> so it may wind up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it 's more practical for all concerned to move on . </s><s> in recent years , truth commissions have gained popularity in many places , notably chile , argentina and el salvador . </s><s> but south africa 's _ the biggest and most powerful , able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test . </s><s> certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its past , as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told of smashed genitals and near suffocations . </s><s> and the commission 's work added much to the knowledge about what happened in south africa between 1960 and 1994 . </s><s> but it will be years before the effect of the commission can truly be judged . </s><s> has anyone really forgiven anyone else ? </s><s> will vendettas persist ? </s><s> no one can answer . </s><s> one thing seems clear , however : four years after south africa held its first non-racial elections , a growing number of south africans want to be done with the past . </s><s> raymond louw , the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter , southern africa report , says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the february session of parliament , in time to remove the issue from next year 's election campaigns . </s><s> `` you simply ca n't have this country torn apart by prosecutions , '' he says . </s><s> `` everybody is going to be howling for an amnesty . </s><s> they already are . '' </s><s> even as archbishop desmond tutu , the commission 's chairman , delivered the report , he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it . </s><s> he said such a move would be highly unfair to those who came forward . </s><s> he suggested instead that there be a two-year time limit , after which anyone not indicted would in effect get amnesty . </s><s> to be sure , there will be opposition to any proposals to limit prosecutions . </s><s> more than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as `` unconscionable . '' </s><s> the idea for a truth commission emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about south africa 's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state to a non-racial democracy . </s><s> during the talks , the white national party government pushed for a blanket amnesty , and the anc refused . </s><s> in the end , only about 250 former police officers came forward , most of them foot soldiers . </s><s> and only two high national party officials , former law and order minister adriaan vlok and police commissioner johan van der merwe , confessed _ to roles in ordering bombings . </s><s> in its report , the commission called the apartheid state the `` primary perpetrator '' of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former officials as former president p.w . </s><s> botha , his former army chief , georg meiring , and the former intelligence chief , niel barnard , responsible . </s><s> these men , and others of lower rank , have not applied for amnesty for the anc , the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution of mandela 's former wife , winnie madikizela-mandela , who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assaults and abductions . </s><s> lesser-known officials could face charges too . </s><s> the anc is held responsible for at least 76 deaths in kwazulu/natal . </s><s> the anc 's problems are further complicated by its efforts to make peace with the largely zulu-based inkatha freedom party . </s><s> virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty . </s><s> yet the report found that inkatha , working with the white government , was responsible for widespread slaughter in kwazulu/natal and in the townships around johannesburg . </s><s> inkatha 's leader , chief mangosuthu buthelezi , and many key party officials stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses . </s><s> but prosecuting chief buthelezi could lead to new warfare in kwazulu . </s><s> part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another factor : the judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheid era is old . </s><s> so why spend the time and the money ? </s><s> at the moment , only one political party is opposed to any form of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential democratic party , a liberal group that was not involved in the violence . </s><s> its head , tony leon , says a new amnesty would only prove that `` the more thuglike your behavior , the more you get away with . '' </s><s> but he concedes that his is a lonely voice . </s><s> `` at this point , '' he says , `` there is little enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past .

hostility toward gay men lesbian	as a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating here , this small city , which bills itself as `` wyoming 's hometown , '' wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men . </s><s> on saturday , at the university of wyoming 's annual homecoming parade , `` pistol pete '' and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger group of marchers _ 450 people , many wearing yellow armbands and carrying signs in support of the 21-year-old student , matthew shepard , who suffered severe head injuries in the attack last week . </s><s> `` hate is not a small town value _ no to violence and evil , '' read one sign , as watchers applauded . </s><s> with passersby spontaneously joining the protest group , two women held another sign that read , `` no hate crimes in wyoming . '' </s><s> two candlelight vigils were held sunday night at churches near the campus . </s><s> at the poudre valley hospital in fort collins , colo. , where shepard 's health continued to deteriorate , the hospital has received so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute bouquets to other patients . </s><s> a vigil at the hospital on saturday evening drew about 500 people . </s><s> `` we live in the equality state , '' shannon rexroat wrote friday in a special edition of the branding iron , the campus newspaper . </s><s> referring to wyoming 's pioneer heritage as the first state to grant women the right to vote , ms. rexroat , the campus newspaper 's editor added : `` that means nothing to me anymore . </s><s> we live in a state where a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay . '' </s><s> but others recalled another side of `` wyoming 's hometown , ''which has a population of more than 26,000 . </s><s> jamie lewis , another editor , said that on friday he was handing out copies of the special edition when a passerby backed away from him and used an anti-gay epithet . </s><s> last week 's brutal assault bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and lesbians , leaders of the local unitarian church said in a letter published sunday in the city 's newspaper , the laramie daily boomerang . </s><s> `` this incident was atypical in its brutality , but not in its underlying motive , '' wrote jeffrey lockwood and stephen johnson . </s><s> gay people in laramie , they wrote , `` are frequently assaulted with derision , intolerance , insult and hostility _ if not guns and ropes . '' </s><s> ric turley , who dropped out of college here after one year in the 1970s , recalled driving here to see his family for christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized billboard on the main highway . </s><s> under a brace of pistols , an advertising appeal for a state history museum had been changed , he said , from `` shoot a day or two , '' to `` shoot a gay or two . '' </s><s> turley , who is gay and said he only came out after he had left wyoming , said that he immediately complained to the museum . </s><s> but returning a month later , he found the message had not been erased . </s><s> after complaining to the museum for a second time , he said he took a can of black spray paint and blotted out the word `` gay . '' </s><s> `` it was this kind of complacency and apathy that allowed this to happen , '' he said of the beating in which two local men have been charged , russell henderson and aaron mckinney . </s><s> according to the local police and prosecutors , the two men lured shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay . </s><s> then , the laramie police say , the pair kidnapped shepard , pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until a passing bicyclist spotted shepard , who was unconscious . </s><s> on sunday , the laramie police said that mckinney had been arrested on thursday at the same hospital in fort collins where shepard was being treated . </s><s> mckinney was being treated for a `` minor '' skull fracture unrelated to the fracas with shepard , said ben fritzen , a laramie police detective . </s><s> president clinton has condemned the attack , saying on saturday , `` i was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against matthew shepard . '' </s><s> clinton urged congress to pass the federal hate crimes prevention act , saying , `` there is nothing more important to the future of this country than our standing together against intolerance , prejudice and violent bigotry . '' </s><s> wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have a hate crime law . </s><s> the latest attempt died in the state legislature in cheyenne in february . </s><s> on saturday , wyoming 's governor , jim geringer , said he was `` outraged and sickened '' by the attack . </s><s> here in laramie , mckinney 's father , bill , also condemned the attack . </s><s> his pickup truck was apparently used in the kidnapping . </s><s> but he also complained about the massive attention by the national media . </s><s> the national press `` blew it totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual , '' mckinney told the denver post . </s><s> `had this been a heterosexual these two boys decided to take out and rob , this never would have made the national news . '' </s><s> shepard grew up in casper until his sophomore year in high school , when his father , an oil rig safety engineer , was transferred to saudi arabia . </s><s> the young man completed high school at a boarding school in lugano , switzerland , where he learned italian and german . </s><s> on saturday , his parents , dennis and judy shepard , released a statement from fort collins thanking `` the american public for their kind thoughts about matthew . '' </s><s> `` he is a trusting person who takes everybody at face value and he does not see the bad side of anyone , '' the shepards wrote . </s><s> `` he has always strongly felt that all people are the same , regardless of their sexual preference , race or religion . '' </s><s> noting that their son was born prematurely and that his `` life has often been a struggle , '' they added , `` he is physically short in stature , but we believe he is a giant when it comes to respecting the worth of others .

sounded more like a crucifixion . '' </s><s> gay leaders hope _ and christian conservatives fear _ that shepard 's death will galvanize congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws . </s><s> conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group 's rights over another . </s><s> in the last two decades , 21 states and the district of columbia have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are committed because of a person 's race , religion , color , national origin , and sexual orientation . </s><s> another 19 states , including colorado , do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws . </s><s> ten states , including wyoming , have no hate-crime laws at all . </s><s> in washington , clinton responded to news of shepard 's death by urging congress to pass the federal hate crimes protection act , which would make federal offenses of crimes based on sex , disability and sexual orientation . </s><s> wyoming has been one of the nation 's holdouts , rejecting three hate crimes bills since 1994 , most recently in february . </s><s> but monday , after shepard 's death , gov . </s><s> jim geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition . </s><s> `` i ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias , anti-hate legislation that can be presented to the wyoming legislature for their consideration in january , '' geringer said . </s><s> the governor met monday morning with dennis shepard , the slain student 's father , and said that the elder shepard did not want his son 's death to become `` a media circus '' and that `` we should not use matt to further an agenda .

intellectual  social democrat  turkish military	a week after the turkish government fell in a corruption scandal , president suleyman demirel on wednesday asked a veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty , bulent ecevit , to form a new government . </s><s> ecevit , who served as prime minister three times in the 1970s , said he would immediately begin working to fashion a government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden parliament . </s><s> he also suggested that although parliament has set april 18 as the date for a new election , he might seek to remain in power for a longer period . </s><s> `` it is wrong to see this government as simply an election government , '' he said . </s><s> `` there are problems that will not wait until an election . '' </s><s> military commanders , who hold ultimate power in turkey , have quietly told senior political figures , including demirel , that they do not want a quick election . </s><s> they fear it will produce a parliament just as divided as the present one , perhaps with the islamic-oriented virtue party as the largest bloc . </s><s> the commanders are also hoping to exclude two of the country 's leading politicians , outgoing prime minister mesut yilmaz and former prime minister tansu ciller , neither of whom they trust , from posts in the new government . </s><s> ecevit must now try to build a government that includes their center-right parties but not them as individuals . </s><s> in a meeting this week the country 's senior policy-making body , the national security council , in which military officers have a strong say , set three priorities for the coming months . </s><s> it said that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiations should dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism , kurdish nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the state apparatus . </s><s> among ecevit 's immediate challenges will be to resolve a political crisis with italy that broke out last month when the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan was arrested in rome and then asked for political asylum there . </s><s> turkey wants ocalan sent here for trial , but italy says it can not extradite him as long as turkey retains the death penalty . </s><s> ecevit ( pronounced eh-che-vit ) is among the few senior turkish politicians who favors the abolition of capital punishment . </s><s> together with demirel , ecevit is often cited by turks who complain about the continued dominance of a geriatric political elite here . </s><s> he is 73 and has been in politics for most of his adult life . </s><s> early in his career ecevit emerged as a spokesman for turkey 's downtrodden masses . </s><s> perhaps more than any other figure , he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate where leftist sympathies were often considered subversive . </s><s> at the same time , however , he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist . </s><s> he was prime minister when turkey sent troops to occupy northern cyprus in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on cyprus . </s><s> he is also uncompromising in his opposition to kurdish nationalism . </s><s> during his terms as prime minister in the 1970s , ecevit successfully undermined efforts to move turkey toward membership in the european union , then called the european economic community . </s><s> he considered it an instrument of capitalist exploitation . </s><s> ecevit has also disturbed the united states by flirting with anti-western ideologies . </s><s> in the early 1990s , during an interval when he worked as a journalist , he traveled to iraq and wrote a series of articles favorable to saddam hussein . </s><s> he recently called for better relations between turkey and iraq , and maintains some of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism that he developed in the 1960s . </s><s> the democratic socialist party , which ecevit heads , is a closely held family fiefdom . </s><s> he and his wife carefully screen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty to ecevit is suspect . </s><s> `` during his terms as prime minister in the '70s , ecevit did not appear to be a consensus builder , '' said ilter turan , a professor of political science at bilgi university in istanbul . </s><s> `` it seems that nowadays he is more accommodating , so from that perspective he may not be bad choice . '' </s><s> `` on many issues that turkish society is encountering now , he represents an orientation which does not seem to be totally in tune with the times , '' turan said . </s><s> `` that would include his position on issues like privatization , integrating turkey more fully into the international system , and the devolution of central authority . </s><s> he has failed to grasp where the world is heading . </s><s> he looks at and analyzes the world in categories that are no longer useful or appropriate . '' </s><s> almost alone among turkish politicians , ecevit lives modestly and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal . </s><s> he speaks fluent english , and his reading tastes run to poetry and intellectual journals such as the new york review of books . </s><s> he has translated the works of t.s . </s><s> eliot into turkish and published several volumes of his own poems .	ecevit , known for personal honesty , begins work to form new government .	bulent ecevit asked to form new government following ouster of msut yilmaz	ecevit tries to form majority govt with yilmaz , ciller parties but not them	ecevit-career politician ; intellectual ; social democrat : turkish military .

md	canada  remembrance day  sniper  abortion  training  ru486  prochoice	while veterans and civic leaders devote wednesday 's national holiday to honoring fallen soldiers , remembrance day has become a chilling vigil for canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement . </s><s> there is immediate fear , because an anti-abortion gunman is believed to be at large . </s><s> and there is long-term anxiety , because even in this country where abortions are legal and publicly funded , women may find access diminishing . </s><s> there is speculation the sniper 's timing is linked to remembrance day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to commemorate aborted fetuses . </s><s> three times since 1994 , a sniper has used this time of year to fire into the home of a canadian doctor who performs abortion , each time wounding the target . </s><s> the attacks were spread across canada _ ontario , manitoba and british columbia . </s><s> u.s. and canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate new york , including the oct. 23 slaying of dr. barnett slepian at his home near buffalo . </s><s> an american anti-abortion activist , james kopp , is wanted for questioning about the shootings . </s><s> police say they do n't know which side of the border he is on , fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals throughout canada . </s><s> `` you must realize canada has the largest undefended border in the world , '' said keith mccaskill , a police inspector in winnipeg , manitoba , and spokesman for the investigation . </s><s> many women 's clinics have tightened security , and doctors who provide abortions have been urged to take precautions . </s><s> `` i would suggest they be extremely aware of their day-to-day goings on , whether during their business day or after hours , '' said toronto detective rick stubbings . </s><s> across canada , there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying their practices or deciding to stop performing abortions . </s><s> some wear bulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes . </s><s> abortion-rights groups say most doctors are not backing down . </s><s> `` there 's a great deal of sadness , '' said susan fox , director of a clinic in edmonton , alberta , that provides abortions . </s><s> `` but there 's also a feeling of determination that we wo n't be deterred or scared by these actions . '' </s><s> marilyn wilson , executive director of the canadian abortion rights action league , sees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young doctors from entering the field . </s><s> `` there are almost no doctors who have stopped performing these procedures , even under the current reign of terror , '' she said . </s><s> `` but young doctors with families would n't necessarily want to do this . </s><s> they may not be willing to put their lives at risk . '' </s><s> the abortion debate is only one of several factors contributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in canada . </s><s> the national society that oversees the speciality says there are about 1,400 doctors in the field , a shortfall of 600 , and most are in their 50s or 60s . </s><s> the society says long hours and limits on fees paid by the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical school graduates as they choose a specialty . </s><s> another problem is that few canadian medical schools offer training in abortion . </s><s> women in canada 's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions . </s><s> those in rural areas often face long journeys , and the province of prince edward island prohibits abortions at its six hospitals , forcing women there to travel to new brunswick or nova scotia . </s><s> abortion-rights groups say the situation would improve if the ru-486 abortion pill were available in canada . </s><s> no drug company has applied for permission to market the pill , either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability . </s><s> the government has been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies , but the health department says this ca n't be done . </s><s> `` it would be a conflict of interest , '' said bonnie fox-mcintyre , a department spokeswoman . </s><s> `` as a regulator we have to stay at arm 's length , so we can judge an application impartially . '' </s><s> abortion was illegal in canada until 1988 . </s><s> now there is no abortion law of any sort , about 100,000 abortions are performed annually , and polls indicate roughly three-quarters of canadians favor pro-choice policies . </s><s> yet public support does n't spare doctors from fear . </s><s> dr. henry morgentaler , who led efforts to overturn the old abortion law and whose toronto clinic was bombed in 1993 , says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom as they reluctantly increase security measures . </s><s> `` unfortunately , doctors who are committed to providing these services will have to accept a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life , '' he said .	canadians fear remembrance day may bring anti-abortion rights violence	canadian abortion-rights movement fears anti-abortion gunman at large	anti-abortion violence feared in canada as remembrance day nears ; fewer mds	canada , remembrance day , sniper , abortion , training , ru-486 , pro-choice

abortion  slepian	the slaying of dr. barnett slepian in his home last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here , but it has not eliminated women 's access to abortion . </s><s> that is because the availability of abortion in the buffalo area , as in much of the united states , is a complex reality , one affected by class and education , medical training and the personal convictions of individual doctors . </s><s> knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists , or if a gynecologist has a personal objection to the procedure , through a referral to a colleague . </s><s> women who are poor , young or uneducated and have no such regular relationships with doctors have to rely on specialized clinics like the one slepian worked in , or on hospitals . </s><s> it is this group _ for whom unplanned pregnancies are far more common than for prosperous women _ that faces a shrinking universe of possibilities as a result of the fear set off by slepian 's killing and the slayings of five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993 , medical experts said . </s><s> `` if you 're well off and well connected , you can get your abortion , '' said dr. stephen wear , co-director of the center for clinical ethics at the university of buffalo , which trains doctors for the buffalo area 's hospitals . </s><s> `` for everybody else , it 's less and less available . '' </s><s> the number of abortions in the united states has been declining steadily since the first years after the supreme court 's roe vs. wade decision legalized abortion in 1973 , according to the alan guttmacher institute , which studies reproductive issues . </s><s> they now number roughly 1.5 million a year , according to reports by guttmacher , or 1.4 million , according to the national right to life committee , the nation 's largest anti-abortion group , which calculates its estimate partly from the guttmacher figures . </s><s> the number of providers who identify themselves as performing abortions as part of their practice is diminishing as well . </s><s> a 1994 guttmacher study , the last one published , found that the number had decreased 18 percent between 1982 and 1992 , to 2,380 from 2,908 . </s><s> moreover , the study said , only 12 percent of the nation 's residency programs routinely offer training in abortions during the first trimester , though many do offer elective courses . </s><s> laura echevarria , director of media relations for the national right to life committee , contends , however , that most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating miscarriages that are similar to those used for performing abortions . </s><s> only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like new york does the availability of abortions continue at a steady level , experts say , though even in these locales there is concern about the decreasing number of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully trained in performing abortions . </s><s> the guttmacher institute , which keeps the nation 's most precise statistics , said that in 1992 , the last year for which it has figures , there were 142,410 abortions in new york that were done by just 151 providers , including 61 hospitals and 44 clinics . </s><s> still , that provider figure greatly understates the number of private doctors who perform them in their offices , medical experts say . </s><s> `` many obstetricians and gynecologists in manhattan provide abortions as part of their palette of services , and have for many years , '' said dr. richard hausknecht , the medical director of planned parenthood . </s><s> `` rich and middle-class women have always had access to abortions , and they always will . '' </s><s> the major threat to availability in the city is less a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training . </s><s> `` the bottom line is that we 're facing an impending shortage of physicians who are adequately trained and willing to do the procedures , '' said dr. john choate , chairman of the new york state division of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists . </s><s> but the lack of training programs is also a result of political pressures on hospitals and universities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear . </s><s> `` physicians tend to lie low , '' choate said . </s><s> `` they do n't publicize the fact that they do them . </s><s> if they do them , they do it quietly out of fear for their practice and for their lives .

buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions have identified a vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his arrest wednesday to bring him in for questioning . </s><s> the man was identified as james charles kopp , 44 , whose last known address was in st. albans , vt. his whereabouts are not known , investigators said . </s><s> investigators said kopp 's car was seen near the amherst , n.y. , home of dr. barnett slepian in the weeks before the doctor , whose work at an abortion clinic had long made him a target of harassment , was killed . </s><s> kopp , according to police records and abortion rights groups , has often moved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics , and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions . </s><s> denise o'donnell , the u.s. attorney for the western district of new york , said kopp was not considered a suspect at this time but was believed to have information material to the case . </s><s> she declined to give details on what evidence was being sought from kopp , describing it only as information that is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise the ongoing investigation . </s><s> ms. o'donnell said that federal law allowed for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person has information that is important to a case . </s><s> `` if kopp is found , he would be arrested , brought to buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence , '' ms. o'donnell said . </s><s> `` then , most likely , the individual would be released . '' </s><s> slepian , 52 , was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on oct. 23 , shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue . </s><s> he was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons when the bullet crashed through a back window . </s><s> he died two hours later . </s><s> law enforcement officials said wednesday 's announcement of the material witness warrant was in part an attempt to underscore the potential danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of remembrance day , a canadian holiday that falls on nov. 11 and that the authorities have associated with some anti-abortion crimes . </s><s> at the same time , the justice department and the fbi were trying to find ways to step up the federal response to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the slepian killing . </s><s> the officials said that attorney general janet reno would soon announce that the justice department , aiming to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries , would revive a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence . </s><s> ms. reno and senior fbi officials , including robert bryant , the deputy fbi director , have met with physician and abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance federal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies . </s><s> federal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task force in 1995 after the killing of a florida doctor . </s><s> the unit , which was charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed , spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence . </s><s> the unit disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy . </s><s> law enforcement officials said that the unit 's operation did help reduce violence at abortion clinics and that , in part , the decision to re-establish it was prompted by ms. reno 's desire to send a renewed message to anti-abortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate these crimes . </s><s> slepian 's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper attacks on abortion doctors in canada and western new york , dating from 1994 . </s><s> none of the attacks have been solved . </s><s> bernard tolbert , special agent in charge of the fbi in buffalo , said at a news conference here wednesday that investigators had not determined whether there is a link between the five killings . </s><s> `` there 's a possibility they could be linked , but certainly no information , '' he said . </s><s> tolbert gave little information about the subject of the material-witness warrant , except to say that kopp 's black 1987 chevrolet cavalier , with the vermont license plate bpe216 , was seen near slepian 's home beginning several weeks before the murder . </s><s> `` we do n't have any idea of where he is , '' tolbert said of kopp . </s><s> `` we are looking for him every place we can , every place he might be . '' </s><s> a photograph of kopp taken in january 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around the united states and canada . </s><s> the national abortion federation has sent out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search for kopp , said melinda dubois , assistant director of womenservices , the clinic where slepian worked . </s><s> she said naming kopp a material witness in the case had not brought relief to the nurses and other workers at the clinic . </s><s> `` i do n't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic feel differently , '' she said . </s><s> `` i do n't want anybody to relax and say , `oh god , they got the guy . ' </s><s> that 's easy to happen . </s><s> i still want people to be very vigilant . '' </s><s> the clinic is the last in the buffalo area that is performing abortions . </s><s> slepian was one of only a handful of doctors in buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure in the face of pickets , protesters and threats . </s><s> since his death , doctors from outside buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing abortion services .	james kopp named as material witness in slaying of abortion doctor	fbi names james kopp as material witness in abortion doctor 's slaying	fbi wants kopp ; information on abortion doctor 's murder ; danger of violence	anti-abortionist james kopp wanted as material witness in slepian killing

operation rescue  buffalo  clinic	rosina lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before operation rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy spring of life rallies , in which hundreds were arrested . </s><s> she was there before lambs of christ demonstrators came to town in 1993 . </s><s> she was on the sidewalk outside buffalo gyn womenservices the morning of oct. 23 , about 12 hours before barnett slepian , the clinic doctor , was fatally shot in his home . </s><s> and she was there friday , brown rosary beads in her hands , a small gold cross on a chain around her neck , quietly praying for abortions to stop . </s><s> `` i 'm heartbroken when i have to come here , '' mrs. lotempio , 58 , said as she stood in the cold , wearing small black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver pin of baby feet . </s><s> `` it 's very difficult out here ; i depend on god , '' she said , after praying for several moments to decide whether to talk to a reporter . </s><s> the bombings , the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents and the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the news media , but people like mrs. lotempio are the foot soldiers in the abortion battle . </s><s> they call themselves street counselors and come to the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed . </s><s> they pray and they talk to women , hoping to change their minds . </s><s> some scream profanities . </s><s> others , like mrs. lotempio , denounce not only the violence against doctors and clinics , but also the blocking of doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients . </s><s> for the approximately 80 abortion opponents here , their protest is more like a job than a political activity . </s><s> there is a schedule . </s><s> people count on them to show up . </s><s> mrs. lotempio , a mother of three and grandmother of six , connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy . </s><s> two decades later , she was haunted by her own question : whether the fetus was male or female . </s><s> `` i just felt horrible and i felt guilty , '' she said , tears in her eyes . </s><s> `` i thought that if i was at the clinic doing something , i could make up for that baby 's life . '' </s><s> during mrs. lotempio 's 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift friday , about a dozen people circled the area in front of the buffalo clinic , saying the `` hail mary . '' </s><s> others take her spot on tuesdays and wednesdays . </s><s> she returns on saturdays , when up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk . </s><s> similar bands of protesters march in front of abortion clinics throughout the united states , and local protesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country . </s><s> at the clinic on main street , north of downtown buffalo , there is an odd sense of community . </s><s> local protesters greet dick , the security guard , by name . </s><s> they sometimes see the `` enemy '' _ abortion-rights volunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic _ in the supermarket or on the soccer field . </s><s> robert behn , one of the protest leaders , even spent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with slepian . </s><s> and several said they cried when they heard of slepian 's death . </s><s> most of the protesters , including mrs. lotempio , were among the thousands of people arrested here in 1992 , the height of anti-abortion activity in buffalo . </s><s> but if operation rescue returns , as planned , for a spring of life reunion in april , mrs. lotempio said , she will not be there . </s><s> instead , she plans to stay in church and pray , to avoid the militancy she says she finds uncomfortable . </s><s> glenn murray , a lawyer for womenservices clinic , said : `` when people from out of town show up , that is when we feel the most danger . </s><s> the local people are a known quantity . </s><s> we know most of the local people by name . '' </s><s> buffalo has been among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the last decade . </s><s> it is a heavily catholic city where thousands of protesters from around the country demonstrated for two weeks in 1992 . </s><s> they failed to close abortion clinics , but 500 people were arrested in rallies that snarled traffic and drew national headlines . </s><s> those rallies , as well as earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils , have had an impact , people on both sides of the abortion issue say . </s><s> the number of clinics performing abortions in the buffalo area has dropped to one from three . </s><s> and after slepian 's death and the retirement this week of another doctor , there are only two doctors in the area for whom abortions form a significant part of their practices . </s><s> the daily demonstrators count this as progress . </s><s> but their perch outside the clinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders than what they call rescues . </s><s> about 30 women a day might go into the clinic . </s><s> after eight years , mrs. lotempio can count eight women who changed their minds and did not get abortions while she was at the clinic . </s><s> inside the clinic , the protests just make a hard job harder , many clinic workers say . </s><s> while some demonstrators simply repeat the rosary , other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the parking lot behind the building , or walk up to the fortresslike front . </s><s> they ask questions like `` do you know what your baby looks like ? '' </s><s> or `` is it a boy or a girl ? '' </s><s> sometimes they accuse people of murder and torture and sin , or threaten them with damnation . </s><s> federal law bars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances , and from leaning signs against its walls . </s><s> some push the limits , frustrating clinic workers and guards . </s><s> the rules protect people from physical harassment , but because of the distance , they turn what could be quiet conversations into catcalls and taunts . </s><s> when a patient goes into the clinic , the protesters `` take on a different persona , '' said melinda dubois , director of the buffalo clinic . </s><s> `` they scream and yell and call us names . </s><s> they lie . </s><s> some days we 're immune to it , but other days it 's just too much . '' </s><s> linda palm , 51 , marching at the clinic on friday , said she identified with the clinic patients . </s><s> when she was 23 , she said , she struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant herself , but decided to have her child , and married the father . </s><s> she began protesting in 1990 , after attending an abortion protest march in albany .	cadre of faithful keep vigil outside buffalo 's abortion clinic	non-violent abortion protestor is a regular presence at buffalo clinic	not all abortion protestors violent ; some avoid militancy ; use prayer , talk	lotempio , womenservices , spring of life , operation rescue , buffalo , clinic

the shore of lake ontario , and every morning , she gives her husband , john , a peck on the cheek before he goes to work . </s><s> she runs errands , like other suburban moms , and spends much of her day taking care of her children . </s><s> but one thing sets mrs. hayes apart from her neighbors . </s><s> as a devoted opponent of abortion , the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a series of traveling speakers , priests and protesters _ many of whom have come to rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion and shutting down clinics that provide it . </s><s> she is one of thousands of people across the country loosely associated with anti-abortion groups like the lambs of christ who have opened their homes to the lambs ' founder , the rev . </s><s> norman weslin , and other itinerant demonstrators . </s><s> while many _ including mrs. hayes _ disavow violent tactics , supporters of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors . </s><s> `` these people who provide father weslin with food and shelter when he comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent , '' said ann glazier , the director of clinic defense for the planned parenthood federation . </s><s> `` it 's just not credible to say they are n't part of the extremist activity that is taking place at these clinics . </s><s> they are still guilty of interfering with women 's access . '' </s><s> but mary quinn , a local organizer for the lambs of christ who also offers her home to protesters , sees matters in a differing light . </s><s> `` taking people in like this is an act of christian charity , '' mrs. quinn said . </s><s> `people who travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those of us that who do n't want to lose their stupid houses . </s><s> we take in these people because they are willing to make the sacrifice . '' </s><s> members of the lambs of christ have been persistent figures in protests at the buffalo women 's clinic where dr. barnett slepian worked before he was shot to death last month . </s><s> although no suspect has been identified in the shooting or in several similar attacks in new york and canada over the past several years , officials are looking to question a vermont man whose car was seen near dr. slepian 's home . </s><s> that man , james charles kopp , has participated in abortion protests for more than a decade , and often was a house guest of other members of the lambs of christ . </s><s> while mrs. hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a clinic 's door , some of those to whom she has given refuge have no qualms about doing so . </s><s> weslin , the leader of the lambs of christ , is one of those who has benefited from mrs. hayes ' hospitality , a modern version of the generosity that christ and the apostles knew well . </s><s> he prides himself on being arrested more than 60 times during protests in front of medical clinics . </s><s> and throughout the 1980s and early '90s , he was active in clinic `` rescues , '' in which protesters tried physically to restrain patients trying to enter clinics . </s><s> weslin stayed at mrs. hayes ' home only once , beginning in may 1996 when he first came to speak at local churches about the anti-abortion movement . </s><s> but during a stay that lasted several months , he was arrested on federal charges of blocking access to a rochester health clinic where abortions were performed . </s><s> he was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison . </s><s> during the protest outside the clinic , he and several other protesters locked themselves in a homemade contraption called `` the oven , '' made of cement and iron . </s><s> it took police officers several hours to lug the device to a horse trailer that carted it off . </s><s> at the same protest , one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic , a move some protesters later said was an accident . </s><s> abortion opponents like mrs. hayes and mrs. quinn speak of attending peaceful observances at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn . </s><s> they talk about counseling women about alternatives to abortion at roman catholic `` pregnancy centers , '' and their support of anti-abortion candidates . </s><s> but they also say they saw nothing wrong with weslin trying to block access to clinics . </s><s> they describe the activity as peaceful resistance meant to stop what they see as murders . </s><s> weslin and the other house guests of mrs. hayes and mrs. quinn come recommended from friends and members of local catholic churches , they said , adding that most are speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events . </s><s> and although they say they would never take into their homes a stranger wanted by the fbi , like kopp , they concede that they sometimes know little about their guests . </s><s> but mrs. hayes and mrs. quinn say they know a lot about weslin . </s><s> an army veteran , he has been a leader of the anti-abortion movement for more than 25 years , they say , and founded a home for unwed mothers . </s><s> mrs. hayes said that when she met him , it was obvious he was a man of peace who `` had a tremendous devotion to the blessed mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs . '' </s><s> barbara fredericks , another local abortion opponent who developed ties to the lambs after weslin came to town , added that the priest epitomized a man of god . </s><s> `` i just knew when i looked at his holy shoes and his simple coat that had been mended 50 times , '' she said . </s><s> `` he was humble , a man who was doing this for a higher purpose , trying to save people through sacrifice and prayer . '' </s><s> opp also has robust defenders among the people who housed him as he rode about the country from protest to protest . </s><s> e. kenny , 20 , said that his parents housed kopp in their st. albans , vt. , home for two years after he spoke at their local church in 1988 . </s><s> during kopp 's stay , he was a pleasure , kenny said , always helping around the house . </s><s> `` he was a nice guy , kind of like an uncle to us , '' kenny said . </s><s> `` he 'd sit around and play video games with us and make us model planes out of wood . '' </s><s> like weslin , kopp was consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about its evils , kenny said , adding that kopp was a gentle man who wanted to become a catholic priest . </s><s> `` he was always in a good mood , '' kenny said . </s><s> `` he never did anything violent at all . '' </s><s> both kopp and weslin have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests . </s><s> the men have moved in the same circles and at times found themselves arrested at the same events . </s><s> mrs. quinn said that weslin told her in a recent telephone conversation that he knew kopp . </s><s> weslin could not be reached for comment , but it is clear that the two men have encountered each other . </s><s> both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a burlington , vt. , health clinic in 1990 that kopp called `` the mill . '' </s><s> and they spent time in the same jail in atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest . </s><s> slepian 's death has abortion opponents like mrs. hayes and mrs. quinn worried , both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media and what it will do to membership in groups like the lambs of christ . </s><s> `` for a long time , you felt like the voice in the desert that was n't being heard , '' mrs. hayes said . </s><s> `` and then there was this horrible tragedy of this doctor 's death becoming the face of the movement . </s><s> `` we 're about saving lives , '' she said . </s><s> the fbi has not talked to mrs. hayes , but kenny said that agents have spoken to him . </s><s> the justice department says that a federal task force set up this week to investigate the killing of slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion violence at various clinics . </s><s> `` it 's fair to say that when investigating these events , we will look at any connection between individuals engaged in criminal conduct , '' myron marlin , a spokesman for the department , said . </s><s> many local catholics associated with the lambs of christ have tried to distance themselves from the killing of slepian . </s><s> they are mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their movement . </s><s> in addition , some people associated with the lambs are offering other possible explanations for the killing . </s><s> some say they believe that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a personal experience with abortion . </s><s> others wondered whether the shooter had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing more abortions . </s><s> the lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient . </s><s> one idea gaining currency among the lambs , and prominently displayed on their web site , suggests that the killing was the result of a plot by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before last week 's elections . </s><s> mrs. hayes says she does n't know the truth . </s><s> `` there are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the clinic because we are drawn to the same place , '' she said . </s><s> `` but you do n't know everyone who shows up and you do n't turn to the person next to you and tell them they do n't belong there . '' </s><s> mrs. fredericks said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was someone `` who had snapped , perhaps because of the importance of the situation . '' </s><s> members of the lambs of christ and other opponents of abortion in rochester wonder whether the killing of slepian will hinder their efforts . </s><s> when weslin first arrived two years ago , he brought new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses , they said . </s><s> `` in many cities , they have a priest for life coordinating and leading rosary marches '' against abortion , mrs. quinn said . </s><s> `` but with father weslin coming here , we could finally come together and feel like we were doing something sacrificial as a group . '' </s><s> mrs. hayes said that she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s , when she heard women speak about `` choice '' in regard to abortion . </s><s> then she saw `` silent scream , '' a well-known anti-abortion film that purports to show the footage of an abortion . </s><s> `` what i saw was the end of life , '' she said . </s><s> she began to volunteer at a catholic pregnancy center where she encouraged women `` not to kill their child . '' </s><s> she also began to house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics where abortions were performed . </s><s> mrs. hayes looked at her 3-month-old daughter , bernadette , then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant , a sonogram taken at 13 weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door . </s><s> she described what could have been her baby 's fate , had she been someone else 's child . </s><s> `` two pounds and two inches ago , she could have been a partial-birth abortion , '' mrs. hayes said , referring to a controversial late-term abortion procedure . </s><s> `` they have the hardest time getting the shoulders out , so they can get to the head and puncture it . </s><s> `` it 's brutal , but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby ? </s><s> there 's no question that these doctors are trying to murder a child .

care	slepian  oct 23  sniper  obstetrics  abortion  schenck  murray  clinic	everyone who knew dr. barnett slepian knew that the slight , graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust , even break , most people . </s><s> there were the strangers who pawed through the garbage cans at his home and growled `` murderer '' as they passed him in the grocery store aisle . </s><s> demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients as they arrived at his office for their checkups , calling him a baby killer . </s><s> outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a week , pickets shouted epithets like `` pig '' to his face . </s><s> slepian , an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor by principle , rarely acknowledged the strain . </s><s> he might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and on weekends . </s><s> then he would do something unexpected , like invite an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic . </s><s> so when he was killed oct. 23 by a sniper 's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in the buffalo , n.y. , suburbs , a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western new york state and canada , friends and relatives wondered not so much that slepian 's work could arouse such murderous violence . </s><s> he had predicted as much himself . </s><s> instead , they wondered , once again , that he persisted in that work , long after other buffalo doctors had surrendered to the pressure of abortion opponents . </s><s> `` he was an incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number 's up , it 's up , and there is nothing you can do about it , '' said h. amanda robb , the doctor 's 32-year-old niece . </s><s> `` and he was incredibly stubborn . </s><s> he said that women had a right to comprehensive health care and since he was a women 's doctor , he was going to provide it for them . '' </s><s> slepian is the third doctor to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the nation . </s><s> to his tormentors , he was simply an abortion doctor . </s><s> to members of the abortion rights movement , he was a martyr for their cause . </s><s> but slepian was far from either . </s><s> in interviews with friends and family members , he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance , a shy man who had rare flashes of anger , a doctor who performed abortions but had no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women who had multiple children they did not want or could not support . </s><s> he was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become emotional and politicized . </s><s> yet there is nothing in his life to suggest he was a crusader in either politics or medicine . </s><s> rather , he was an obstinate , unassuming man who did a remarkable thing . </s><s> out of contrariness and out of conscience , say those who knew him , he refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be , and for that , he paid with his life . </s><s> the clues to slepian 's flinty brand of commitment lie , in part , in his upbringing . </s><s> his was a family that took success for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty . </s><s> to earn money for medical school , he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi . </s><s> he made few friends , but those he had were friends for life . </s><s> when their wives were sick , he called repeatedly . </s><s> when they were lonely , he flew to their side . </s><s> slepian , who was known as bart , used to tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes a doctor to the least suffering , and that he performed abortions because it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse . </s><s> slepian often expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after abortion . </s><s> `` do n't they get it ? '' </s><s> his clinic staff recall him saying more than once . </s><s> he had the same impatience for women like those he remembered from his residency in inner-city buffalo , who had child after child and no means of support . </s><s> `` he had the contempt for that of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it in the world , '' ms. robb said . </s><s> he believed that to ban abortions or , just as shameful in his view , to stop teaching young doctors how to perform them , would not correct the human imperfections that he found so irritating . </s><s> `` there are 1.5 million abortions performed in this country , '' his niece said , `` and he just felt we 're not equipped to handle 1.5 million unwanted children . '' </s><s> when he was killed , at the age of 52 , bart slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of amherst , complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored . </s><s> slepian 's trajectory to that comfortable doctor 's life had been unconventional . </s><s> his grandfather , a russian jewish immigrant who started out selling shoelaces from a pushcart in boston , propelled all five of his sons into harvard at a time when few jews met the university 's blue-blood standards . </s><s> his father , in turn , decreed that his own three sons would be doctors or earn ph.d 's . </s><s> `` we grew up in a home where there was tremendous , tremendous , tremendous respect for education , '' said serena robb , slepian 's sister , who is four years older than him . </s><s> `` if you got an a , it was ok if you got a b , you got yelled at . '' </s><s> the family 's means did not match its expectations . </s><s> slepian 's father , philip , had joined his own father 's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes . </s><s> soon after bart was born in 1946 in boston , the company failed , so to save money , the father moved his family of six to his in-laws ' apartment in mckeesport , pa. , and then to rochester , n.y. once settled , slepian 's father set himself up as a freelance writer , crisscrossing the country in his old studebaker , researching the origins of prominent citizens at the library of congress and writing their stories for small-town newspapers . </s><s> he sold articles by the hundreds , and was still writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93 . </s><s> the success that was expected of bart slepian did not come easily . </s><s> as a child , he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him , his sister recalled . </s><s> an unexceptional student , he went to a local community college before transferring to the university of denver , where he majored in zoology . </s><s> rejected by medical schools in the united states _ the fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied one year in belgium and then enrolled at the autonomous university for medicine in guadalajara , mexico . </s><s> his friends remember him as funny and obstinate , a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline who beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool . </s><s> `` bart had certain beliefs , strongly held , '' said richard schwarz , an old classmate who is an internist on long island . </s><s> `` he always said you should n't sit around whining about things , '' schwarz said . </s><s> `` he would say , `go after what 's yours and what 's right . '' ' </s><s> bart slepian 's determination surfaced in quirky ways . </s><s> he once insisted on going to the top of the world trade center , despite a crippling fear of heights . </s><s> to get to the window , he crawled , inch by inch . </s><s> `` i said , `you do n't have to do this , ' '' recalled schwarz , who was with him at the time . </s><s> `` and he said , `i want to do it . ' </s><s> bart made it count . </s><s> he felt alive . '' </s><s> forced to drop out of school every few semesters to work , he lived in reno with his sister serena , a widow who was struggling to take care of two young daughters . </s><s> she worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer , sharing her tips with him while he drove a cab , cleaned barns at a ranch and worked as a laboratory assistant at the local veterans administration hospital . </s><s> after graduation , he moved to buffalo for his medical residency . </s><s> there he married lynne breitbart , a registered nurse 10 years his junior , and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice from a doctor who was about to retire . </s><s> he had a soothing , unhurried manner . </s><s> when a patient of his , patti durlak , was diagnosed with diabetes , slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for her insulin injections . </s><s> `` the other doctor said , `just deal with it , ' '' mrs. durlak recalled . </s><s> `` not dr . </s><s> slepian . '' </s><s> in most ways , he was a typical suburban family man , working six days a week and spending his free time at little league games and county fairs with his four sons . </s><s> but by the late 1980s , he and other abortion doctors in buffalo were under siege . </s><s> in one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape , the rev . </s><s> paul schenck , one of the fieriest of buffalo 's anti-abortion leaders , threw himself in front of the doctor 's car as he pulled into the clinic driveway . </s><s> slepian parked on the street . </s><s> as he pushed his way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators , schenck cupped his hands around his mouth and lunged , shouting , `` slepian , you pig ! '' </s><s> slepian 's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private life were futile . </s><s> the protests followed him home and the man who had been so bashful as a boy found himself , uncomfortably , at the center of controversy and attention . </s><s> once , he showed his anger . </s><s> in 1988 , when demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his home as he opened hanukkah presents with his children , the doctor came out brandishing a baseball bat . </s><s> he denied he hurt anyone , but a town judge ordered him to repair one protester 's smashed van window and pay a portion of another 's medical bills . </s><s> the outburst surprised his family and friends . </s><s> it was not slepian 's style to make a public fuss , much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters . </s><s> `` stress ? '' </s><s> his oldest brother paul responded gruffly when asked about the doctor 's mood . </s><s> `` i never heard the word used in my family , except as an engineering term . </s><s> he said it was a nuisance . '' </s><s> mrs. slepian did not respond to requests for an interview . </s><s> she expressed rage to the buffalo news shortly after the shooting . </s><s> she said that whoever had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection herself . </s><s> she also spoke out after schenck 's brother , robert , another anti-abortion leader who frequently confronted slepian , sent a bouquet of flowers . </s><s> mrs. slepian denounced him as `` a hypocrite . '' </s><s> after the confrontation in 1988 , slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits , letters and levity to deal with the protesters . </s><s> in 1993 , when a man active in the anti-abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor 's garbage cans at home , slepian tried to treat the incident lightly . </s><s> `` they hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers , '' he joked . </s><s> he tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper . </s><s> he told the buffalo news that abortion protesters should turn their energies to helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and counseling . </s><s> in a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly calling him a murderer , his critics were inciting violence . </s><s> slepian accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction , his friends said , but resented the personal attacks . </s><s> `` he thought it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger , '' said his lawyer , glenn edward murray . </s><s> so slepian took a step that few of the nation 's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared . </s><s> he insisted that if he tried hard enough , he might cut through the venom . </s><s> to the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety , slepian began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized outside the womenservices abortion clinic in buffalo , where he worked two days a week . </s><s> he surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing for what they euphemistically called a `` house call , '' or demonstration at the doctor 's home , and invited the protest 's organizer , the rev . </s><s> robert behn , to breakfast . </s><s> their hourlong conversation the next morning was inconclusive , behn said , dismissing slepian 's gesture as an `` attempt to get people to like him . '' </s><s> he asked slepian how performing abortions affected him spiritually . </s><s> in response , he recalled , the doctor said , `` i 'm fine spiritually . '' </s><s> slepian , meanwhile , focused more on time away from home with his family . </s><s> he planned to take a cruise next spring . </s><s> he bought a time-share apartment near disney world in florida . </s><s> `` he had so many plans , '' said ellen fink , a close friend of the couple for 15 years . </s><s> `` he was n't done . </s><s> he was n't done living yet . '' </s><s> still , sometimes during the most casual conversations , a shadow would appear . </s><s> when his wife gave him a gray african parrot for a birthday gift , slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy . </s><s> `` he would talk about the funeral he wanted , '' mrs. fink said . </s><s> `` he said he did n't have a lot of friends and wanted all of them to come in separate cars , one in each car , so he 'd have a long procession . '' </s><s> in the week before his death , slepian had reasons to be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality . </s><s> a medical checkup had revealed a blockage of his heart , mrs. fink said , recounting a conversation with mrs. slepian the day of the slaying . </s><s> a blockage is a sign of probable coronary artery disease . </s><s> he was to have more tests the following week . </s><s> `` i said , `lynne , just relax , it 's going to be ok , ' '' mrs. fink recalled . </s><s> that same day , the national abortion federation sent a fax to the womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks on abortion doctors that occurred in early november . </s><s> marilynne buckham , the clinic director , sent it to slepian . </s><s> `` he definitely took it seriously , '' she recalled . </s><s> typically , the doctor did not share any concerns he might have felt . </s><s> `` it was a normal day , '' said tammi latini , his office assistant . </s><s> `` we were horsing around . ' </s><s> that evening , the slepians went to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of slepian 's father . </s><s> shortly after they returned home , a sniper 's bullet smashed through the kitchen window , killing slepian as he chatted with his wife and sons . </s><s> the protesters returned to the clinic five days later , the first day it reopened . </s><s> mrs. buckham , the director , said slepian would not have been surprised . </s><s> they have their routine . </s><s> `` he never wanted a day to end on a bad note , '' she said . </s><s> `` at the end of the day , i would always say , `thank you for coming .

teen-agers , delaying fire squads ' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162 , officials said saturday . </s><s> per-olof ortarsen of goteborg 's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks . </s><s> the first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received , ortarsen said at a news conference . </s><s> he and other officials declined to comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant victims . </s><s> the minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response . </s><s> ''no

pitching enabled the yankees to advance past cleveland in the american league championship series . </s><s> david wells is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a padres ' lineup that is generally less effective against left-handed pitching . </s><s> orlando hernandez has four terrific pitches , pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal game 4 of the alcs and earned the start in game 2 of this series . </s><s> david cone should benefit from six days ' worth of rest when he starts game 3 , as well as being able to pitch in warm southern california . </s><s> mariano rivera 's stuff might be as good as it has been all year , and mike stanton continues to be a dominant postseason pitcher . </s><s> reasons for concern : the erratic andy pettitte , who needs a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches low and away , and jeff nelson , who lost his command in his last brief outing . </s><s> offense there were signs in the alcs that the offense is coming out of its collective slump _ chuck knoblauch is getting on base consistently , derek jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through the middle , bernie williams had three hits in game 6 , and scott brosius has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup . </s><s> but the yankees do have holes : chili davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the fastballs of kevin brown and andy ashby , and tino martinez 's postseason funk is a problem . </s><s> the yankees could use a contribution from jorge posada , who will start in games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitches low in the strike zone , where he can hit with power . </s><s> defense the yankees have the best defense in baseball , excellent up the middle with jeter and knoblauch , and at third with brosius . </s><s> nobody 's really taken advantage of the fact that williams has a poor arm in center field , but rest assured that ken caminiti , steve finley and greg vaughn will try . </s><s> the indians did expose the fact that the yankees ' pitchers have trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third base . </s><s> baserunning the yankees run well as they take extra bases , particularly paul o'neill , brosius , jeter and knoblauch going first-to-third ; williams can make mistakes . </s><s> the yankees probably wo n't be able to steal against kevin brown , who has an effective slide step , but they could be aggressive against andy ashby , or the combination of sterling hitchcock and jim leyritz . </s><s> padres hitting except for jim leyritz , no one in the san diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the moment . </s><s> tony gwynn has n't been as consistent as he usually is , ken caminiti and greg vaughn have been streaky . </s><s> but the padres are a veteran team capable of putting the ball in play , getting runners on base and then moving them along , and so long as they are getting exceptional pitching , that 's all they really need . </s><s> quilvio veras , the leadoff hitter , is adept at drawing walks and steve finley , who has become more pull conscious in the last two years , could try to take aim at the right field stands in yankee stadium . </s><s> vaughn 's power could be a factor if the yankees ' pitchers do n't jam him enough to keep him from leaning over the plate . </s><s> pitching kevin brown is the best pitcher in this series , capable of winning three games if necessary , should padres manager bruce bochy choose to start him in games 1 , 4 and 7 . </s><s> but at some point , san diego will need a big outing from either andy ashby or sterling hitchcock . </s><s> when ashby 's right , he 's hitting the corners with his sinking fastball and his slider , and when his command is suspect , he gets pounded . </s><s> hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball to great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two rounds of the playoffs , but the yankees ' left-handed hitters may cause him some concern . </s><s> san diego 's middle relief is the weakest aspect of the team , with randy myers and mark langston from the left side ( the stuff of each has waned ) . </s><s> but if a lead can be delivered into the hands of closer trevor hoffman , he 'll keep it . </s><s> defense they mostly catch the ball and avoid mistakes , though they are unspectacular . </s><s> shortstop chris gomez and the second baseman veras are adept at turning double plays , and caminiti won a gold glove at third base last year ; wally joyner has good hands at first ; the center fielder steve finley is extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball to the infield . </s><s> tony gwynn 's range is better toward the right field line , not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps . </s><s> the yankees will be able to run on the arm of vaughn in left field . </s><s> baserunning veras can steal bases ( 24 ) this year , and finley can in a tight spot , as well . </s><s> in general , however , the padres are a slow , plodding team , though caminiti and vaughn are good at going first-to-third , and gwynn wo n't make mistakes on the bases . </s><s> pitching to the padres quilvio veras : a switch-hitter who has more power right-handed ; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he 's hitting right-handed , jam him with fastballs when he 's batting left-handed . </s><s> steve finley : a left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball . </s><s> left-handers like david wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside . </s><s> tony gwynn : when he 's hot , he 's impossible . </s><s> when he 's not hitting well , he can be anxious early in the count , and he should be fed breaking balls out of the strike zone . </s><s> greg vaughn : big-time power on anything high and over the plate . </s><s> because he likes to pull the ball , you must pitch him on the outer edge , occasionally jamming him to keep him honest . </s><s> ken caminiti : more power right-handed , a better hitter left-handed . </s><s> these days , he 's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs up in the zone . </s><s> wally joyner : with runners on base , he 'll try to jump on a fastball early in the count . </s><s> is not a strong hitter and can be jammed . </s><s> chris gomez : like derek jeter , likes to hit pitches inside out , to right field and through the middle . </s><s> he can hit with power if you make a mistake with a breaking ball . </s><s> ruben rivera : an impatient hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone . </s><s> carlos hernandez : looks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike zone . </s><s> can struggle against breaking balls . </s><s> jim leyritz : no apparent holes right now , can hit fastballs in and away . </s><s> best bet is to get ahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls . </s><s> pitching to the yankees chuck knoblauch : hard throwers like to jam him with fastballs because he stands on top of the plate , which is why he gets hit so often . </s><s> derek jeter : sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches at his feet , but if you do n't get the ball in far enough , he can hammer the ball over the wall in right . </s><s> paul o'neill : the yankees ' best pure hitter , he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away , particularly after there is one strike . </s><s> bernie williams : a switch-hitter who has trouble resisting chest-high fastballs . </s><s> when he lays off them , he is a much better hitter , and he did this in the last game of the cleveland series . </s><s> chili davis : has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a count , but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt . </s><s> cheats some now to get his bat started , making him vulnerable to off-speed pitches . </s><s> tino martinez : nothing seems right at the moment . </s><s> is anxious and chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in the count , and is n't taking advantage of mistakes when they 're made . </s><s> scott brosius : a great breaking ball hitter , but he can also drive a fastball a long way when he anticipates , as cleveland 's charles nagy now knows . </s><s> jorge posada : when batting left-handed , he fares very poorly against splitters , curveballs and sliders . </s><s> ricky ledee : like all young hitters , he has a tendency to expand the strike zone and chase pitches out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count . </s><s> kevin brown likely will attack him aggressively . </s><s> saturday 's pitchers kevin brown : best sinking fastball in the game ( 91-93 ) mph , a four-seam fastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone , a slider that breaks down and away from right-handed batters , and a forkball that dives at 88-89 mph . </s><s> holds runners well . </s><s> david wells : aggressive , aggressive , aggressive , challenging hitters with fastballs . </s><s> his curveball can be exceptional , and his changeup has improved . </s><s> throw strikes : allowed as many home runs ( 29 ) as walks ( 29 ) , but has not allowed a three-run homer or a grand slam all year .	yankees set pitching staff lineup for first three games of world series	pitching and defense may give yankees edge against padres in series	assessment of yankees '

the field at yankee stadium , they were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the cleveland indians home and the yankees to the world series . </s><s> that 's not to say the umpires will mess up in the world series , but they have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural progression of postseason games . </s><s> all right , so ted hendry wo n't be in the world series ; the umpires ' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the world series . </s><s> joe brinkman wo n't be here either , even though the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division series and the world series . </s><s> the three american league umpires who are on the six-man world series crew did work in the first round of the playoffs . </s><s> one of them , richie garcia , will be the crew chief and behind the plate in saturday night 's opener at yankee stadium . </s><s> gene budig , the al president , friday called garcia , a 24-year veteran , one of the league 's `` most respected umpires . '' </s><s> but after saturday night , garcia will move to right field sunday night for game 2 . </s><s> now why does that combination sound familiar , richie garcia and right field ? </s><s> ah yes , the last time garcia worked a post-season series at yankee stadium , he was the umpire in game 1 of the league championship series two years ago when a young fan from new jersey _ no name , please ; he has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught derek jeter 's fly ball just as tony tarasco , baltimore 's right fielder , prepared to catch it . </s><s> garcia ruled no interference , that it was a home run , then said oops after watching a television replay clearly showing interference . </s><s> too late . </s><s> the call helped the yankees win the first game and set the tone for the series . </s><s> `` even though he made a mistake , you know you have the best out there , '' a baseball official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said . </s><s> that knowledge comes as small consolation to the orioles . </s><s> budig , too , acknowledged that umpires , like players and managers , are n't perfect . </s><s> `` major league umpires are skilled at what they do , but they are human , '' he said in a telephone interview . </s><s> `` day in and day out they do a very good job for major league baseball . </s><s> rounds one and two have been difficult , but that happens from time to time .

'' </s><s> in the division series against boston , brinkman , the plate umpire , was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the plate that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting of mike hargrove , the indians ' manager , three pitches into game 2 , and dwight gooden , their starting pitcher , 19 pitches later . </s><s> hendry was right or wrong , depending on one 's point of view , for his noncall of interference on travis fryman in the 12th inning of game 2 of the alcs . </s><s> that ruling went in favor of the indians . </s><s> little else did . </s><s> in game 4 , jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target throw from sandy alomar jr. hit jim mckean , who jumped to try to get out of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field . </s><s> a batted ball , omar vizquel 's line drive , struck hendry in game 6 . </s><s> but the worst call of game 6 was hendry 's on a force play at second base . </s><s> hendry called bernie williams safe , ruling that vizquel 's foot came off the base before he caught the ball . </s><s> members of the yankees indicated friday that they , too , thought the call was wrong . </s><s> `` i do n't know , '' williams said when asked what he thought , `` but i 'll take it . </s><s> it was a big play .

waiting for an interference call as the ball rolled to a stop behind him and the decisive run scored . </s><s> the yankees came back to win the series , however ; knoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience had helped him . </s><s> facing wall with a one-ball , no-strike count , knoblauch had to duck under a runaway fastball . </s><s> two balls , no strikes . </s><s> wall

mistake . </s><s> jorge posada , the yankees ' catcher , jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy , perhaps to remind wells of the conventional wisdom : you must pitch vaughn on the outer edge of the plate . </s><s> posada returned to the plate , called for an outside fastball , wells threw . </s><s> vaughn 's swing was short and quick , the ball making a click sound off the bat , like a well-struck golf ball , before carrying over the wall in right-center field . </s><s> tie game . </s><s> wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning , before jamming veras with an inside fastball . </s><s> veras ' bat snapped on contact , but it was enough to send a looper into short center field , a single . </s><s> gwynn stepped in , having hit a single in his first two at-bats , and looked for a sign from the third base coach tim flannery . </s><s> with a runner on first , he likes to try to pull a ball through the right side of the infield . </s><s> wells fired a fastball ,

provision threaten spending bill	house and senate negotiators agreed thursday to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women , giving an unusual victory on capitol hill to advocates of abortion rights . </s><s> but the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding the federal election commission . </s><s> that provision could scuttle the spending bill , which would finance the treasury department and the postal service and which still must be approved by the house and senate . </s><s> the contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans , which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing age , to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved by the food and drug administration for use in this country _ birth control pills , diaphragms , inter-uterine devices , norplant and depo-provera . </s><s> currently , only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods . </s><s> the house and senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this year . </s><s> but the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval and persuaded republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion on the matter . </s><s> the cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket cost of health care for women . </s><s> and many male members of congress seemed persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women , since almost all of the 285 federal health plans cover viagra , the male impotency drug . </s><s> thursday , with pressure building to resolve the spending bills before oct. 9 , when temporary financing of the government expires , the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their conference report on the $ 13.4 billion bill for the treasury department and postal service . </s><s> rep. nita lowey , d-n.y. , who pushed the contraceptive measure through the house , hailed thursday 's agreement as the first major accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the republicans took control of congress in 1994 . </s><s> she said the negotiators had agreed to include the measure because in an election year they did not want to be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as rejecting a measure that had passed both the house and senate . </s><s> but many democrats said the were upset that the bill contains a provision that is seen as interfering with the independence of the federal election commission . </s><s> that provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general counsel and staff director . </s><s> the provision is aimed at getting rid of lawrence noble , the current general counsel , who has investigated the campaign finance practices of groups like the christian coalition . </s><s> the contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have helped stall four spending bills . </s><s> the three other bills that are stalled in part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture bill , in which

wilderness , the senate on thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife habitat in alaska . </s><s> the road , barely 30 miles long , would slice across the edge of a wildlife refuge and

been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted , and the white house is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with house democrats as it is with the house republican leaders . </s><s> on monday , white house negotiators , led by chief of staff erskine bowles , tried to determine whether democrats would accept a deal to finance for six months the departments of state , justice and commerce , which oversees the census bureau . </s><s> the deal would put off until next march the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting people . </s><s> bowles told the group of democrats that the house republicans were willing to give on a number of outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement on the budget , but that they were digging in their heels when it came to financing the census for six months . </s><s> the democrats met in the office of minority leader dick gephardt . </s><s> the rationale for the half-year financing is that by next march the supreme court is expected to rule on whether using sampling is legal or constitutional . </s><s> the supreme court has already agreed to review two lower court rulings that said sampling would violate federal law . </s><s> oral arguments on the cases are set for november . </s><s> but house democrats balked at the idea of six months ' financing for the census , arguing that even if the supreme court allowed sampling , the republicans would be under no obligation to approve money for a census that included sampling . </s><s> `` the general feeling among many democrats was that even if we won the case , there would be a lot less leverage in march , especially if it was the only issue left to be debated , '' said a house democratic official who insisted on anonymity . </s><s> democrats contend that now is the time to press the republicans , while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign . </s><s> rep. lucille roybal-allard , d-calif. , who attended the meeting monday , said , `` it was , sort of , this is where we are . </s><s> we 've been able to accomplish great things , what do you think ? </s><s> we made it very clear that unless the census was included , along with some other issues , like school construction , the deal would n't be acceptable . '' </s><s> statistical sampling would allow the census bureau to estimate populations that are difficult to count , and would have the largest effect on the counting of african-americans in cities and blacks and hispanics in rural areas , groups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means . </s><s> republicans fear , and democrats hope , that the method would raise the count of people living in traditionally democratic areas , giving the party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts are drawn following the 2000 census . </s><s> at monday 's meeting , the democrats reminded administration officials that clinton had promised that he would veto any legislation that restricted the census bureau 's ability to conduct an accurate census . </s><s> `` i ca n't think of any way that restricts the census more than not to fully fund it , '' said rep. carolyn maloney , d-n.y . </s><s> the willingness of house democrats , including gephardt , to press the president on the issue represents a realization of their leverage with clinton , who will need all of their support in the coming impeachment inquiry . </s><s> `` gephardt is a major player now , and the irony is we helped make him that , '' said rep. christopher shays , r-conn. , who supports the use of sampling in the census . </s><s> the democrats ' position also indicates how little trust many have in the white house on this issue . </s><s> the proposal to finance the departments of commerce , justice and state for six months is similar to one reached last november between bowles and house speaker newt gingrich . </s><s> the idea then was that holding all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling . </s><s> but house democrats were not consulted before that agreement was struck and later grumbled about it . </s><s> at a meeting of the democratic caucus tuesday , ms. maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the white house and declared that clinton had promised that he would hold firm on the census and that she believed him , a participant said . </s><s> the statement was greeted with laughter . </s><s> `` there is a certain level of suspicion because there have been times when we have been cut out , ''said the house democratic official . </s><s> `` but i have to say , there has n't been much evidence of that , this time .

valley . </s><s> the internet offered a new deal in computing , a fresh opportunity for entrepreneurs to try to break microsoft corp. 's firm grip on the personal computer software business . </s><s> leading the challenge was netscape communications corp. , whose software for browsing the world wide web had ignited the internet boom . </s><s> netscape chairman james clark spoke boldly of attacking microsoft head-on . </s><s> he borrowed imagery from the movie `` star wars , '' referring to microsoft as the death star and netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance . </s><s> microsoft answered with a vengeance . </s><s> it dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it . </s><s> it prodded computer makers and others to distribute its browser , folded the browser into its industry-dominant windows operating system and gave the browser away free _ a campaign intended to `` cut off their air supply , '' as a senior microsoft executive described it . </s><s> but not only competitors like netscape have encountered microsoft 's force . </s><s> microsoft 's partners , its corporate customers and professional investors who finance new ventures have all collided with it . </s><s> a close look at microsoft 's no-holds-barred push into the internet software business offers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry . </s><s> some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought by the justice department and 20 states , scheduled to go to trial this month , charging that microsoft at times went too far _ and violated antitrust laws . </s><s> regardless of the legal outcome , previously unreported details about incidents in the suit and the other examples provide a more complete picture of microsoft in action . </s><s> _ when compaq computer corp. considered loading netscape 's browser instead of microsoft 's on its personal computers , microsoft threatened to stop selling its windows operating system to compaq . </s><s> the company quickly changed its mind . </s><s> _ after spyglass inc. began supplying microsoft with its early browser technology , microsoft announced that it would give away its browser free . </s><s> the timing came as a rude surprise to its partner spyglass . </s><s> the company lost most of its revenues almost overnight , as the technology , which it had also been licensing to companies besides microsoft , suddenly became available free . </s><s> _ when america online inc. , which competes fiercely with microsoft 's online service and electronic commerce divisions , went shopping for browser technology , microsoft made an offer that was too good to pass up : if america online used microsoft 's browser as the main one for its millions of subscribers , microsoft would give america online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal computers using windows . </s><s> _ when intel corp. began developing its own internet software , microsoft complained . </s><s> intel , the leading maker of the microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most personal computers running windows , pulled back . </s><s> the chip maker decided that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with microsoft took priority . </s><s> _ microsoft 's reach in computing has become so pervasive that nearly every year now , silicon valley 's top venture capitalists meet privately with a team of top microsoft executives to learn about the company 's plans . </s><s> the goal , one venture investor observed , was to `` stay out of the way of the steamroller . '' </s><s> microsoft adamantly denies that it has broken any laws in these or similar situations . </s><s> the company plays the game of business hard , and its executives acknowledge that without apology . </s><s> yes , microsoft says , rivals may suffer and partners may be irritated occasionally . </s><s> but the company insists its actions are guided by its main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively and conveniently to the millions of people who use its software . </s><s> most people in the computer industry say that living in microsoft 's world means routinely making accommodations to it . </s><s> microsoft 's power emanates from its near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operating systems , the master control programs that run computers . </s><s> `` because it owns the operating system , microsoft is the essential utility of the information age , '' said james moore , president of geopartners research inc. , a technology consulting firm . </s><s> `` it acts as a kind of gatekeeper to the pipeline of computing innovation , sitting there and deciding whether to help some innovation or slow it down . '' </s><s> for months , microsoft and netscape had talked on and off , circling each other warily . </s><s> but the event that would define them as unflinching rivals was a meeting on june 21 , 1995 , in a second-floor conference room at netscape 's headquarters in mountain view , calif. that meeting , according to the justice department and 20 states suing microsoft , was the high-tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke-filled railroad cars that inspired passage of the nation 's antitrust laws a century ago . </s><s> on that day , they say , microsoft made netscape an illegal offer to divvy up the market for internet browsing software , a collusion pact that netscape rejected . </s><s> microsoft replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and that the company has never tried to divide the browser market . </s><s> bill gates , microsoft 's chairman and principal strategist , did not attend the mountain view gathering , but he consulted by telephone with the microsoft team . </s><s> two people who did attend that june meeting have been named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week : netscape president james barksdale and daniel rosen , microsoft 's general manager of new technology . </s><s> in the trial , the government will contend that microsoft presented netscape with an all-or-nothing offer , according to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation . </s><s> relying heavily on notes taken in the meeting by netscape executive vice president marc andreessen and on the testimony of barksdale , prosecutors are expected to assert that the microsoft proposal had several elements , both incentives and requirements . </s><s> microsoft , according to the people questioned by the government , would invest in netscape , taking a 15 to 20 percent stake , give netscape technical information and fine-tune microsoft 's operating systems so that netscape 's software would run better on windows . </s><s> in return , the people say , netscape would give microsoft a seat on its board , license its technology to microsoft , give microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts and not make a browser for the next generation of the microsoft operating system , windows 95 , which was shipped two months after the june 1995 meeting . </s><s> and microsoft , the people added , did what it has always denied it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business negotiations , by offering netscape preferential access to the windows `` application program interfaces , '' or apis , the links that enable other companies ' programs to run smoothly on the windows operating system . </s><s> by turning down the deal , netscape , they say , would not have that preferred access to microsoft technology _ a threat that microsoft fiercely denies making . </s><s> barksdale , netscape 's 55-year-old chief executive , told a colleague that the encounter with microsoft in june 1995 was `` the damnedest meeting i 've ever attended in 35 years in business . '' </s><s> had netscape accepted microsoft 's offer , it would have had microsoft 's money and its endorsement . </s><s> netscape would have also been free to sell its browser for use in earlier versions of windows and for use on other operating systems like apple 's macintosh and unix , a powerful system used mainly in corporations and research labs . </s><s> `` but if we had licensed our technology to microsoft and stepped aside , the best we could have hoped for was becoming a company with sales of $ 100 million or so and hoping to be bought out by microsoft , '' said clark , a former computer scientist at stanford university who founded silicon graphics inc. , a computer graphics pioneer , before starting netscape . </s><s> `` we did n't start netscape for that . '' </s><s> for any company , a meeting with microsoft is often a charged affair . </s><s> every computing device from keyboards to disk drives , and every software program from games to browsers , must mesh smoothly with microsoft 's windows operating system . </s><s> this is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use , but it also gives microsoft its role as the industry 's gatekeeper . </s><s> and since microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond the operating system , other companies are put in the uneasy position of requiring microsoft 's cooperation to be able to compete against it . </s><s> and in the software industry , where every program is rendered in the digital code of 1 's and 0 's , the lines that divide competition and cooperation are often blurred . </s><s> the talk about that line at the microsoft-netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating system _ the `` platform , '' in computer terms _ and the application programs , sometimes called `` solutions , '' that run on top of the operating system . </s><s> the government suit states that in sworn testimony , chris jones , a microsoft manager who attended the meeting , `` admitted that microsoft `absolutely ' intended to persuade netscape not to compete . '' </s><s> microsoft reads jones ' testimony very differently , as evidence mainly of the company 's clarifying its position . </s><s> if netscape stayed on the applications or solutions side of the operating system , the two companies could be partners , microsoft said . </s><s> but if netscape tried to become a player in the platform space , they would compete . </s><s> microsoft released portions of the jones deposition in september as evidence that the government had quoted the microsoft manager out of context . </s><s> q . </s><s> do you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence netscape not to compete ? </s><s> absolutely . </s><s> but again , persuade in the sense of force or persuade in the sense of , hey , we think we can have a great business relationship together . </s><s> later in the deposition , a justice department lawyer asked jones whether any of the microsoft executives intended to suggest that `` there would be any consequences to netscape or its business if netscape chose to go in the platform direction you 've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction . '' </s><s> jones replied : `` the conversation was something like the following : `we 're in the platform business . </s><s> we 're going to invest heavily in this part of the platform because we feel it 's critical to our technologies . </s><s> that 's a done deal . ' </s><s> and we 're asking them : `what is your business ? </s><s> is your business platforms or solutions ? </s><s> if it 's platforms , we 're in the platforms business . </s><s> we 're competing . '' ' </s><s> microsoft portrays such comments as innocuous statements of fact . </s><s> but to netscape , the same remarks could be taken as a warning , if not a threat . </s><s> this is because internet browsing software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the windows operating system . </s><s> the browser , sitting on top of the operating system , could supplant windows as the main desktop screen on users ' machines and the main layer of programming for starting other software applications . </s><s> in addition , netscape 's browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running java , an internet programming language developed by sun microsystems inc. , a microsoft rival . </s><s> in technical terms , netscape 's upstart platform could replace microsoft 's apis as the essential utility of computing . </s><s> indeed , andreessen had boasted in public of netscape 's ambition to relegate microsoft 's windows to so much software plumbing underneath the browser . </s><s> by the june meeting , microsoft certainly viewed netscape as a serious potential challenger to windows , the corporate crown jewel . </s><s> on may 26 , 1995 , in an internal memo , `` the internet tidal wave , '' gates wrote : `` a new competitor `born ' on the internet is netscape . </s><s> their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share , allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on . '' </s><s> netscape 's strategy , gates wrote , was to `` move the key api '' into the browser `` to commoditize the underlying operating system . '' </s><s> the broader inquiry : government sees arm-twisting the federal government and the states have recently broadened their allegations against microsoft by adding evidence that it tried to bully intel , apple computer inc. and other companies to squelch competition . </s><s> they say that like the netscape meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by microsoft , which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors and partners . </s><s> one episode that fits the pattern , the prosecutors contend , was an effort by microsoft to pressure intel to shelve the development of multimedia and internet software and to limit its cooperation with netscape . </s><s> intel 's main business is making the microprocessor chips that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the windows operating system . </s><s> indeed , the fortunes of intel and microsoft are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred to as a single , powerful entity , `` wintel . '' </s><s> but intel also employs hundreds of software engineers , mainly at its intel architecture labs in hillsboro , ore. and while intel and microsoft are partners , they have also had their conflicts , typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal computer industry , which they dominate together . </s><s> federal and state investigators have focused on microsoft 's strong reaction to work being done by intel 's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in no uncertain terms during a meeting at intel 's santa clara , calif. , headquarters on aug. 2 , 1995 . </s><s> the contentious session was attended by several executives from intel and microsoft , including gates and intel chairman andrew grove . </s><s> an internal intel memo stated that gates made `` vague threats '' about supporting intel 's competitors and that he was `` livid '' about intel 's `` investments in the internet and wanted them stopped . '' </s><s> later , intel did pull back from its multimedia and internet software development . </s><s> steven mcgeady , an intel vice president who attended the august 1995 meeting , is scheduled to appear as a witness for the government . </s><s> microsoft replies that the government 's accounts of meetings like those with netscape and intel are fanciful distortions , created by using a biased selection of documents and witnesses . </s><s> the government 's case , microsoft asserts , betrays an utter failure to accept the computer-industry reality that microsoft routinely meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will work well with windows . </s><s> sometimes the talks , microsoft says , go on to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology or a microsoft investment , as the company discussed with netscape . </s><s> in the trial , microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser market was the result of its own business acumen and netscape 's missteps . </s><s> to document netscape 's errors , microsoft issued a subpoena last month and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book , `` competing on internet time : lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft , '' which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former netscape executives . </s><s> the book does chronicle the mistakes made by netscape . </s><s> but its authors , michael cusumano of the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management and david yoffie of the harvard business school , think microsoft is hardly blameless . </s><s> `` microsoft 's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired , all but inviting retaliation from competitors , the government and even customers , '' yoffie said . </s><s> emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment , yoffie added , `` i think microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did without crossing the line as much as it did . '' </s><s> the spyglass link : rewards and perils of a partnership on april 6 , 1994 , gates and 20 microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the company 's headquarters in redmond , wash . </s><s> the subject was the internet and how it might revolutionize the computer software business . </s><s> few concrete plans were made that day , but microsoft executives insist that a direction was set . </s><s> `` our vision from the outset was to unite the two worlds of the windows desktop and the internet , '' said steven sinofsky , a microsoft executive who attended the meeting . </s><s> yet microsoft badly trailed netscape in the browser field . </s><s> to hasten its entry , microsoft licensed its early browsing software from spyglass inc. of naperville , ill . </s><s> the first meeting between the two companies was initiated by spyglass in april 1994 . </s><s> at the time , it was a tiny company and eager to do a deal with microsoft . </s><s> spyglass was selected as the commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the national center for supercomputing at the university of illinois . </s><s> in the summer of 1994 , douglas colbeth , president of spyglass , met with clark of netscape at o'hare international airport in chicago . </s><s> the two men talked in the united airlines red carpet room , reserved for business-class passengers , and colbeth recalled clark telling him , `` we 're going to take microsoft head-on . '' </s><s> at the time , colbeth recalled thinking to himself , `` great , now microsoft will really want to license from me . '' </s><s> today , he noted : `` remember , we were a company with a couple dozen people and almost no money in the bank . </s><s> netscape had jim clark , with his money and reputation , and big-time venture capital backing from silicon valley . </s><s> netscape had a very different agenda . '' </s><s> by july 1994 , microsoft had become quite interested in the spyglass technology , colbeth says , and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement the following december . </s><s> microsoft , colbeth recalls , always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating system , but its timing was accelerated by netscape 's rapid rise . </s><s> `` microsoft was initially hoping to charge for the browser , '' colbeth said . </s><s> but on dec. 7 , 1995 , gates declared that microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser into windows but would give it away . </s><s> the announcement caught the industry , even colbeth , by surprise . </s><s> at the time , spyglass had licensed its technology to 82 other companies , including ibm and digital equipment , for use in their software products _ a licensing revenue stream of about $ 20 million a year . </s><s> as a result of microsoft 's move , spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year , as smaller internet software companies went out of business and big customers shifted to microsoft 's free browser . </s><s> spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace its lost sales , which it succeeded in doing eventually . </s><s> `` whenever you license technology to microsoft , you have to understand it can someday build it itself , drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business , '' colbeth said . </s><s> the nonoption compaq : suddenly sees the light well into 1996 , netscape 's share of the browser market continued to rise , while microsoft made little headway , even though its browser was free . </s><s> industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that netscape 's browser was the clear technical leader . </s><s> in april 1996 , netscape 's navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the web , compared with 4 percent using microsoft 's internet explorer , according to zona research . </s><s> so the biggest personal computer maker , compaq , thought it made sense to give customers netscape 's browser instead of microsoft 's . </s><s> but microsoft would not stand for that _ and compaq had no choice but to give in . </s><s> in june 1996 , compaq wanted not only to load the more popular netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for microsoft 's internet explorer , which was delivered to the computer maker with windows 95 . </s><s> microsoft informed compaq that if it removed internet explorer , the computer maker would lose its license for windows , said stephen decker , compaq 's director of software procurement , in testimony to federal investigators . </s><s> the ultimatum from microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed , `` notice of intent to terminate license agreement . '' </s><s> faced with being denied the essential operating system , compaq quickly reversed course and kept the internet explorer icon . </s><s> microsoft asserts that windows and internet explorer are a single product and that microsoft alone defines what is in the product . </s><s> nothing in its contracts , microsoft adds , prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies . </s><s> while the cutoff letter microsoft sent to compaq seems an unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer , microsoft chief operating officer bob herbold insists that `` to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray microsoft as an arrogant company is unfair . '' </s><s> noting that a compaq executive is a witness for microsoft , herbold said , `` we are totally dependent on tremendous relationships with key companies like compaq . '' </s><s> at netscape , however , the compaq episode was a watershed . </s><s> `` that was the singular act that got me going to the justice department , '' barksdale recalled . </s><s> barksdale said he regarded microsoft 's tactic of forcing compaq to buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product , the windows operating system , as `` an illegal act and absolute proof that microsoft was a monopolist . '' </s><s> after investigating the incident , the justice department and the states agreed with barksdale that microsoft was illegally tying the sale of one product to another . </s><s> microsoft replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating system . </s><s> and from the outset , microsoft says , it intended that windows and its internet explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated , as they are now in windows 98 . </s><s> thus , microsoft insists , there is no product-tying violation of antitrust laws . </s><s> in a separate case , a federal appeals court sided with microsoft , upholding the principle that the company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and declare it a single product . </s><s> but in june 1996 , when compaq wanted to offer the netscape product instead of microsoft 's browser , most industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different software programs . </s><s> `` it took a long time for the integration strategy to play out , '' said a former senior microsoft researcher . </s><s> `` back then , integration was basically bolting a browser onto windows . '' </s><s> the `balancing act ' : america online tosses in towel america online chairman stephen case refers to dealing with microsoft as `` a delicate balancing act . '' </s><s> that balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996 , when microsoft used the lure of giving america online a featured place on the windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip . </s><s> to gain access to computing 's most coveted real estate , america online agreed to make microsoft 's internet explorer the main browser for its online subscribers , who now number more than 13 million . </s><s> yet throughout 1995 , as microsoft prepared to introduce windows 95 , the most significant improvement ever in its operating system , case was knocking on the door of the justice department . </s><s> his complaint was that microsoft was going to place its new online service , microsoft network , a direct competitor to america online , prominently on the desktop screen of windows 95 , which was introduced in august . </s><s> this bundling tactic of using the industry-dominant operating system to market microsoft network , or msn , case argued , gave microsoft an unfair advantage in the young but fast-growing online business . </s><s> the justice department listened and investigated . </s><s> but ultimately , the government decided against taking any action . </s><s> at america online 's headquarters in vienna , va. , microsoft was both feared and loathed at the time . </s><s> america online had a designated `` microsoft watcher , '' a young m.b.a. who tracked its adversary 's every move . </s><s> above the desk in his small , windowless office was a picture of gates . </s><s> beneath the picture , in large block letters , were the words `` the enemy . '' </s><s> though america online was the clear leader in the online services business , it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault by a rival as rich and aggressive as microsoft . </s><s> when he had visited the microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier , case recalled , gates had bluntly assessed microsoft 's options by saying he could buy 20 percent of america online , all of it or enter the online business on his own and `` bury you . '' </s><s> a threat or merely a statement of the facts ? </s><s> `` a bit of both , '' case said recently . </s><s> `` but he was mainly articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood . '' </s><s> yet by 1996 , microsoft and america online found they had reason to cooperate . </s><s> with the exploding popularity of the internet 's world wide web , the conventional online companies , like america online and compuserve , had to provide their customers internet access as well as their own services . </s><s> america online had its own browser , but to keep pace with the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with netscape or microsoft . </s><s> for both software companies , a deal with america online , which had 5 million subscribers at the time , could mean a big surge in browser use and market share . </s><s> netscape seemed the natural partner for america online , since both companies were microsoft rivals . </s><s> on march 11 , america online did announce that it would buy netscape technology , but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula . </s><s> the next day , america online announced a more significant deal with microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser america online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked for netscape 's navigator . </s><s> to win the deal , microsoft offered to give america online a start-up icon on the windows desktop _ precisely the kind of equal treatment on the main windows screen that case had asked the justice department to require of microsoft . </s><s> `` after we agreed to its internet explorer browser , microsoft allowed us to be bundled on the windows desktop , '' case said . </s><s> `` it was an example of microsoft 's pragmatic side . '' </s><s> the pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software business . </s><s> as a result , its new online service , msn , would have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival , america online . </s><s> `` it was bill 's decision , '' said former msn general manager russell siegelman , referring to gates . </s><s> `` he sent me e-mail on it . </s><s> he said he did n't think it would hurt msn that much . </s><s> i disagreed with him . '' </s><s> to other microsoft executives , gates expressed a different view of the likely impact on msn . </s><s> he told senior vice president brad silverberg that putting america online on the windows desktop would amount to `` putting a bullet through msn 's head , '' according to a deposition taken by the justice department . </s><s> in the antitrust suit , the government asserts that the america online deal shows how microsoft used the power of its windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against netscape . </s><s> david colburn , a senior vice president of america online who took part in the browser negotiations with microsoft , is a witness for the government . </s><s> today , microsoft has overhauled its internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest web sites in fields like travel , personal finance , automobile retailing and news . </s><s> and it is putting these sites , along with e-mail and search features , in an all-in-one site that uses the name msn.com . </s><s> `` i still regard microsoft as a primary threat , '' case observed . </s><s> `` microsoft has a history of getting it right in the long run , and there 's no reason to think it wo n't in this business as well . </s><s> we will always be in microsoft 's cross hairs . '' </s><s> the lesson : do n't confront a steamroller at netscape 's headquarters in silicon valley , the strategy today is one of avoiding head-to-head competition with microsoft whenever possible . </s><s> `` do n't do something that is in microsoft 's path _ that 's the lesson learned , '' observed clark , the netscape chairman . </s><s> silicon valley 's venture capitalists , the investors who finance so many of the nation 's high-tech startups , generally follow the netscape formula these days . </s><s> yet that still leaves ample room to prosper . </s><s> for while competing directly with microsoft is dangerous , the software industry as a whole is an engine of wealth creation , job generation and technical innovation . </s><s> and there is an ambivalent side to the venture community 's relationship with microsoft . </s><s> for if a start-up can not steer clear of microsoft entirely , the favored option is to be bought out by microsoft , which has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising technology and people . </s><s> `` microsoft understands start-up innovation and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company , '' said james breyer , managing partner of accel partners , a venture capital firm . </s><s> as microsoft has grown , it has come to be seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes the business environment , like a weather front . </s><s> `` microsoft is incredibly pervasive , '' said stewart alsop , a partner with new enterprise associates , a venture capital firm in menlo park , calif. at the board meetings of the companies in which his firm has invested , two issues always come up , he said : `` one is the price of the company 's stock , and the other is what microsoft is going to do . '' </s><s> in the last few years , microsoft has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists . </s><s> the meetings are part of microsoft 's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations with silicon valley . </s><s> `` we work hard to provide clarity about where we 're going and where we 're not going , '' said greg maffei , microsoft 's chief financial officer . </s><s> last year 's conference took place in october at the quadrus office building on sand hill road in menlo park , the wall street of high-tech venture investing . </s><s> maffei led a team of five microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists , one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the minds of many of his peers : `` how do i invest in a company that stays out of the way of the steamroller ?

case spine law	microsoft antitrust suit aggressive quarter century	us v microsoft corporation trial reveals ambiguity antitrust law	antitrust law broadly word  court ruling ambiguous  little guidance	window  operate system  tie  justice  browser  software platform	the case of united states vs. microsoft corp. , the government 's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years , is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments . </s><s> whatever the outcome of the trial , scheduled to begin monday in u.s. district court in washington , an almost certain appeal will leave to the supreme court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines . </s><s> the case focuses on microsoft 's windows , the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today . </s><s> the government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company . </s><s> microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to windows . </s><s> however grand the economic stakes , the legal dispute is narrow . </s><s> the government says that microsoft 's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the internet illegally stifle competition . </s><s> the contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting netscape communications corp. 's navigator browser for microsoft 's internet explorer . </s><s> they also prohibit them from removing from the windows main screen , or desktop , links to sites on the world wide web run by microsoft or its partners . </s><s> microsoft 's contracts with companies that connect people to the internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the web require favored treatment for internet explorer over navigator in exchange for links on the windows desktop . </s><s> in the wake of the lawsuit , microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these requirements , though it could reinstate them at will . </s><s> microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers , including easier internet access . </s><s> the justice department says that the bundling of explorer with windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of windows 98 amount to `` tying , '' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another . </s><s> the contracts with manufacturers and internet services are illegal , the government says , because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect microsoft 's existing monopoly in operating systems . </s><s> the latter threat is key , according to the justice department . </s><s> browsers have the potential , like an operating system , to act as a software platform on which other programs run . </s><s> so contracts intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the windows monopoly . </s><s> many antitrust experts say the problem facing the justice department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary . </s><s> professor lawrence white of new york university , who was chief economist of the justice department 's antitrust division in the early 1980s , says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous . </s><s> no one , he said , `` would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils , tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts . '' </s><s> his point , shared widely among economists , is that some tying benefits consumers if , for example , it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs . </s><s> but tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power . </s><s> the courts , white says , have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad , which is the nub of the legal dispute . </s><s> microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling windows and explorer passes what might be called a `` gross '' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit , whether or not it causes long-term damage to competition and , therefore , ultimately to consumers . </s><s> the justice department says that microsoft 's practices must clear a higher hurdle : yielding `` net '' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition . </s><s> so which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws ? </s><s> the simple answer is that no one knows for sure , which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment . </s><s> consider a 1985 case , aspen skiing co. vs. aspen highlands skiing corp. , and a 1951 case , lorain journal co. vs. united states . </s><s> in the first , aspen skiing , the owner of three major ski runs in aspen , colo. _ the monopolist _ had for years sold a ticket in cooperation with aspen highlands , a competitor , that gave skiers access to both companies ' runs . </s><s> when aspen skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement , its rival 's revenues shriveled and the rival sued . </s><s> the supreme court ruled that aspen skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers . </s><s> in the lorain journal case , the only local newspaper in lorain , ohio , refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a new radio station . </s><s> here , too , the supreme court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers . </s><s> indeed , in aspen skiing , the court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival , a precedent that augurs well for the justice department , which seeks to force microsoft to install netscape 's browser alongside its own . </s><s> but charles rule , a legal consultant to microsoft , says that in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit . </s><s> the courts , he argues , never pounced on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service . </s><s> nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm . </s><s> rule argues that microsoft 's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits . </s><s> besides , he says , unlike the actions taken by the lorain journal or aspen skiing , microsoft 's contracts do not prevent consumers from installing netscape 's browser or from using the web sites of microsoft 's rivals . </s><s> in truth , though , neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product design . </s><s> in jefferson parish hospital district no . </s><s> 2 et al . </s><s> vs. hyde , another case cited by both sides , the supreme court in 1984 recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service . </s><s> yet , the court said , a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately . </s><s> that principle could undercut microsoft 's defense that the functional interdependence of windows and explorer requires bundling . </s><s> but microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it alleges tying . </s><s> microsoft will also draw support from several court rulings that allowed ibm to change the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment . </s><s> but perhaps microsoft 's best argument is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test . </s><s> the courts , microsoft will emphasize , steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products . </s><s> the justice department 's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers , so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar 's worth of benefits today but , by stamping out competition , drive prices up by $ 1,000 tomorrow . </s><s> the justice department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers . </s><s> experts agree that the courts will subject microsoft 's restrictive contracts with internet companies to a balancing test . </s><s> but exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is up for grabs . </s><s> a balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to internet sites and of features of a bundled windows-explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operating systems . </s><s> but a test that makes good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice . </s><s> `` balancing tests are impossibly difficult and arbitrary , '' said rep. thomas campbell , r-calif. , who is a former law professor at stanford university . </s><s> `` the practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like microsoft almost certain victory . '' </s><s> microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a simpler `` predation '' test for exclusionary contracts . </s><s> under this standard , a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later . </s><s> microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation , which amounts to victimizing its customers , than it would defending itself against a charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good . </s><s> the antitrust record , says william baxter , who headed the antitrust division under president reagan , is littered with `` contradictory , ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical '' verdicts . </s><s> he and other legal experts agree that if nothing else , that record leaves plenty of legal leeway for the supreme court , should it hear the microsoft case , to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law .	the microsoft antitrust suit is the most aggressive in a quarter century	u.s. vs microsoft corporation trial reveals ambiguity of anti-trust laws	anti-trust laws broadly worded , court rulings ambiguous .  little guidance .	windows , operating system , tying , justice , browsers , software platform

antitrust act of 1890 _ is brief , vague and malleable . </s><s> the combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years , depending on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts . </s><s> sponsored by sen. john sherman , an ohio republican who was the younger brother of the civil war general william tecumseh sherman , the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trusts in oil , steel and railroads . </s><s> farmers , laborers and small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power . </s><s> but the trusts , large national holding corporations , were viewed by many others as engines of modernization and industrialization . </s><s> economists at the time opposed the sherman act , and the law that congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise . </s><s> no one knew what impact it would have , but one senator , quoted in matthew josephson 's `` the robber barons , '' explained that nearly everyone agreed that `` something must be flung out to appease the restive masses . '' </s><s> the act 's two key provisions , sections 1 and 2 , mention `` conspiracy , '' `` restraint of trade '' and `` attempt to monopolize . '' </s><s> yet while the sherman act is now interpreted as the magna carta of competition , it never uses the term . </s><s> after it was passed , critics of the trusts derided the `` impenetrable '' language of the sherman act and called it the swiss cheese act . </s><s> but by the early 1900s , the political climate had changed . </s><s> the growing antagonism for the trusts , especially as income gaps widened , was tapped by an avowed trustbuster , theodore roosevelt , who became president in 1901 . </s><s> `` the sherman act has always been an elastic piece of social legislation , used to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power , '' said eleanor fox , a professor at the new york university law school . </s><s> the model trust _ and the principal target of the trustbusters _ was standard oil . </s><s> shrewdly , roosevelt made a distinction between good trusts , which thrived because of their superior efficiency , and bad trusts , which grew not as the result of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices . </s><s> throughout the 1880s and '90s , standard oil 's rivals had complained about the company and the business practices of its founder , john d. rockefeller . </s><s> but during those years , the price of kerosene _ burned to light the nation 's homes _declined steadily . </s><s> so standard oil , it could could reasonably be argued , was an `` enterprising monopoly . '' </s><s> in the early 1900s , though , standard oil raised prices in the united states to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price war against royal dutch/shell in europe , where standard oil did face genuine competition . </s><s> when consumers were hurt by the standard oil monopoly , popular support for antitrust action against the company swelled , encouraged by roosevelt and his successor , william howard taft . </s><s> the federal suit against standard oil was filed in 1906 , and the supreme court approved the breakup of the company in 1911 . </s><s> standard oil and the microsoft case , historians observe , have some common themes . </s><s> both were dominant companies of their day , and bill gates , the microsoft chairman , has been called a modern rockefeller . </s><s> `` but there is no presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction in the microsoft case , '' said ron chernow , author of `` titan , '' a best-selling biography of rockefeller . </s><s> `` and rockefeller , '' chernow added , `` never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage as bill gates has had .

extensive consistent	microsoft case outgrowth investigation complaint since 1989	ibm  os2  window  norris washington  ftc  antitrust  microsoft  clinton	the government 's antitrust scrutiny of microsoft , the world 's largest independent software company , has spanned republican and democratic administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators . </s><s> but it has by no means been an example of consistent , coordinated public policy . </s><s> nor , by all accounts , of politics . </s><s> instead , like the software industry itself , the government 's pursuit of microsoft has taken leaps , hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started in 1989 . </s><s> it was in november of that year , on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in las vegas , nev. , that bill gates , microsoft 's chairman , looked like he 'd been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from ibm _ which at the time dominated microsoft and the entire computer industry . </s><s> the two companies _ ibm , then the leading maker of personal computers and microsoft , the leader in pc operating system software _ were collaborating on the design and marketing of a new operating system called os/2 . </s><s> but microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product , windows . </s><s> the industry trade press was full of worried articles : which system was going to become the new standard ? </s><s> with gates standing uncomfortably at his side , james cannavino , an ibm divisional president , said that the two companies wanted to `` clear the air . '' </s><s> os/2 was the future , he said . </s><s> as for windows , he added , it would remain a niche product for under-equipped computers . </s><s> windows , he asserted , would never receive all the advanced features of os/2 . </s><s> gates certainly did not look happy . </s><s> but he did not disagree . </s><s> the news conference got little attention , just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications . </s><s> but a few weeks later , norris washington , a senior antitrust lawyer with the federal trade commission , happened to read one of those articles , in byte magazine . </s><s> `` ibm and microsoft have now defined their unified vision of graphical operating environments , '' the article said , `` and it looks sort of like a u.s. economic model , '' divided into lower- , middle- and upper-class products . </s><s> as washington saw it , ibm and microsoft were colluding to divide the operating-system market _ a potential violation of antitrust law . </s><s> soon the ftc staff opened an investigation of microsoft and ibm and since that small first step , microsoft has been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges , month after month , year after year , for the last nine years . </s><s> now comes the antitrust trial scheduled to begin on monday , with a multiplicity of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a dozen different investigative inquiries during that nine-year span . </s><s> microsoft , today the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market value of nearly $ 234 billion , presents a huge and highly visible antitrust target . </s><s> yet , while the company 's allies ask , `` what is the clinton administration 's political agenda in going after microsoft ? '' </s><s> the answer seems to be there is none . </s><s> in interviews , more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of the government or of microsoft _ all say the justice department 's antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations . </s><s> as for politics , all the officials agreed that the antitrust division operates independent of the administration 's political considerations . </s><s> charles rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division during the bush administration , and he is now a washington lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for microsoft . </s><s> `` when i was there , '' rule said of his justice days , `` the white house was punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided to do . </s><s> there was no communication between antitrust and other branches of government . '' </s><s> asked if he believed that policy had changed under the clinton administration , he said : `` not really . </s><s> i 've seen nothing to suggest it . '' </s><s> joel klein heads the antitrust division now , and in an interview dealing with his division 's role in the clinton administration 's technology policy , not specifically relating to the microsoft case , he said : `` there is no statutory restriction , but as a practical matter , civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without any political contact . '' </s><s> klein said , by way of examples , that he might discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with the defense department or transportation department . </s><s> `` but never the white house , '' he said . </s><s> `` for a significant case , we might call the white house and say `an hour from now we are going to hold a press conference . ' </s><s> '' `` the last time there was any interference , '' he added , `` was the dita beard-itt case . '' </s><s> mrs . </s><s> beard , a lobbyist for itt corp. , was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $ 400,000 donation to the republican national convention had `` gone a long way '' toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the nixon administration 's justice department . </s><s> the authenticity of the memo was never proved , and mrs . </s><s> beard always denied writing it . </s><s> in any case , klein says , `` since watergate , it 's been immaculate . '' </s><s> in the case of microsoft , neither president clinton nor vice president al gore has ever volunteered a comment . </s><s> in answer to a question during a news conference in may , just before the suit was filed , clinton said : `` i have taken the view that i should not comment on matters within the justice department . </s><s> at this time , i do not think i should depart from that policy on this case , even though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector of our economy . </s><s> but i have to say , based on what i know to date , i have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the justice department has handled the matter . '' </s><s> since then , clinton has said nothing else about the case , publicly at least . </s><s> and gore , who generally represents the administration on technology issues , has never commented at all . </s><s> in rule 's opinion , the administration would be foolish to involve itself , even if it were politically acceptable to do so . </s><s> `` it would be a little odd for the administration to push the justice department in this suit , '' he said . </s><s> `` it would be a policy mistake and a political mistake . </s><s> i would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that . '' </s><s> taking sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous , particularly since the democrats rely on silicon valley companies for political donations and support . </s><s> in fact , the present and former government officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the inquiries conducted during the last nine years . </s><s> they began at the ftc . </s><s> soon after washington read that article in byte , the ftc staff opened an investigation of the windows-os/2 question . </s><s> but as has happened so often in the following years , turns in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant . </s><s> microsoft abandoned its agreement with ibm , and windows quickly grew to be the industry standard , while os/2 remained a cipher . </s><s> but as that issue faded , once government investigators began looking at microsoft they found other things that troubled them . </s><s> in 1991 washington , who still works for the ftc , informed microsoft that the investigation was being expanded . </s><s> the agency , his letter said , was now trying to determine whether microsoft was using its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other areas . </s><s> that general idea lies at the heart of the present suit . </s><s> one former senior ftc official said the commission staff had confidence in the case but realized that the reagan-era commissioners , who had to approve any suit , might have a different view . </s><s> `` we knew the commission might have difficulty with a monopolization case , '' the former official said . </s><s> `` they had n't brought a case in years . '' </s><s> and in fact , in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charges . </s><s> the deadlock served as a dismissal . </s><s> then , a few months later , the justice department decided to pick up the case . </s><s> `` it was farther along than most cases we got , '' recalled robert litan , a former senior official in the justice department 's antitrust division who is now at the brookings institution . </s><s> `` usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few documents , '' he said . </s><s> `` but this was a fully researched record . </s><s> they gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done . '' </s><s> the justice department lawyers picked up the same thread . </s><s> `` the general idea behind our inquiry , '' litan said , `` was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to cement a monopoly in other areas . '' </s><s> in 1995 , microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing pc makers to buy one copy of a microsoft operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating system , ms-dos or windows , was installed . </s><s> the company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another . </s><s> the charges in the present suit are similar in many ways . </s><s> even with the agreement , the government investigations continued . </s><s> that same year , justice department investigators showed up at the offices of netscape communications corp. for the first time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry . </s><s> `` america online had been complaining , '' a senior netscape executive recalled , `` because microsoft was bundling the microsoft network , '' a competing online service , `` with windows . '' </s><s> once more , market forces overtook the investigation . </s><s> the microsoft network never grew particularly popular while america online prospered and grew . </s><s> but , not surprisingly , new complaints filled the void . </s><s> in may 1995 , anne bingaman , the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division , remarked : `` we get complaints about microsoft all the time . </s><s> we have become a kind of microsoft complaints center . </s><s> and we take them very seriously . '' </s><s> in 1996 , netscape 's first complaint arrived . </s><s> in a letter to the justice department , netscape said that microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor microsoft 's browser , used to explore the world wide web , over the one marketed by netscape . </s><s> the next year the justice department formally charged microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of windows to installation of the company 's web browser on new computers . </s><s> `` it seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree , '' a natural extension of that case , recalled litan , who had left the department by then . </s><s> a federal district court judge agreed , but an appeals court panel overturned that ruling this summer . </s><s> in the meantime , last may the justice department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit against microsoft , which is scheduled for trial on monday . </s><s> it contends that microsoft has engaged in bundling , tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years . </s><s> `` a good part of this case is just round ii of the case we dealt with in round i , '' in the early in the 1990s , litan said . </s><s> or , as the former senior ftc official put it , `` there 's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here . '' </s><s> but through the years that thread has been twisted , pulled and spun by hundreds of different hands .	microsoft-ibm collaboration seen as start for building antitrust case	government 's pursuit of microsoft corp. is extensive but not consistent	microsoft case outgrowth of investigations and complaints since 1989	ibm , os/2 , windows , norris washington , ftc , antitrust , microsoft , clinton

intuit	netscape  intel  antitrust suit  browser  bundle  apple  real network	shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against microsoft corp. in may , joel klein , the assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department 's antitrust division , met with a silicon valley executive . </s><s> the executive recalls telling klein that unless a case went beyond the internet browser market , it would have little effect on microsoft 's power to stifle competition across the computer industry . </s><s> klein replied that he understood the computer executive 's concerns . </s><s> but he said time was running short and the strongest evidence in hand involved microsoft 's battle against netscape communications corp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating the internet . </s><s> `` this is a netscape case , '' the executive recalls klein saying . </s><s> but five months later , the case that the government is bringing to trial on monday extends well beyond netscape and the browser war to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as `` a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct '' by microsoft . </s><s> netscape , the government insists , is still a prime example of the pattern _ but only one of several examples . </s><s> the 12-person witness list for the justice department and 20 states suing microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case since may . </s><s> james barksdale , netscape 's president and chief executive , will appear first , but he will be followed by executives representing a cross section of the nation 's high-technology companies including intel , ibm , sun microsystems , apple computer , america online and intuit . </s><s> in bringing a more ambitious , complicated case to trial than the one it filed in may , the government has chosen a high-risk strategy . </s><s> the law states that new evidence can be added to a suit after it is filed , but not new charges . </s><s> and so , in his federal courtroom in washington , u.s.district judge thomas penfield jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far afield from the original suit . </s><s> but if the government wins its broadened case , the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on microsoft . </s><s> in may , the government 's suggested steps amounted to equal treatment for netscape 's browser and microsoft 's browser . </s><s> but the government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on remedies , if it wins the case . </s><s> the remedies under consideration now include more basic changes in microsoft 's business practices _ perhaps even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen microsoft 's grip on computing . </s><s> that would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform that microsoft 's foes would applaud . </s><s> `` the government has doubled the bet and doubled the stakes , '' said david yoffie , a professor at the harvard business school who is co-author of the book , `` competing on internet time : lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft . '' </s><s> meanwhile , in the microsoft camp , the government 's strategy is dismissed as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in june that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit . </s><s> that ruling came in a separate case , involving the interpretation of the consent decree that microsoft signed with the justice department in 1995 . </s><s> in the june ruling , a federal appeals court said that microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry-standard windows operating system and call them one product . </s><s> the appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government 's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products , bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market . </s><s> `` with the appeals-court ruling in june , the government lost the heart of its case , '' said charles rule , a former senior official in the justice department , who is now a consultant to microsoft . </s><s> `` so it has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything it can find _ even evidence the justice department has had for years _ into the gun barrel and see what hits . '' </s><s> the june appellate ruling did shake the prosecution team . </s><s> but mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the justice department who had been urging that the case be broadened , according to people who have worked on the investigation . </s><s> at the same time , they say , new evidence was coming in as the investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule approved by the court . </s><s> speed was a priority from the outset , they say . </s><s> the justice department and the states filed their suit in may to move before microsoft 's new operating system , windows 98 , was introduced in june . </s><s> while not seeking to block the release of windows 98 , government lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as pc makers and computer users adopt this latest version of microsoft 's windows operating system , which functions as the central nervous system for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold . </s><s> the key allegations , government lawyers note , have not changed since may _ namely , that microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets . </s><s> `` but the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the may filing was the browser , '' said one person who worked on the case . </s><s> `` the real game plan was always to get a broader case . '' </s><s> what is more , one person noted , the prosecution team was not at full strength until shortly before the suit was filed . </s><s> david boies , a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at cravath , swaine & amp ; moore who successfully defended ibm in its 13-year confrontation with the government , was named as special counsel for the justice department last december . </s><s> but boies , who left cravath last year , did not start working full-time for the justice department until mid-april , because he was still finishing private cases for his own firm , boies & amp ; schiller . </s><s> the antitrust suit filed in may leaned heavily on the netscape story , mentioning microsoft 's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the complaint and a supporting memorandum . </s><s> but it also prominently mentioned microsoft 's tactics against sun microsystems , creator of java , an internet programming language , and cited it as an `` example '' of microsoft 's behavior . </s><s> `` it was crafted as a template that could be added to without much stretching , '' one person involved in the case said . </s><s> and so , as new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern , klein step by step approved the widening of the case , the person said . </s><s> and that explains , the person continued , how it is that evidence that has been in the hands of the justice department for years has been added to the case since may ; only after gathering new evidence did it become apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case . </s><s> for example , the government has added the contention that microsoft pressured intel corp. , the big microchip maker and a close partner of microsoft , to curb its development efforts in multimedia and internet software because they might conflict with microsoft 's plans . </s><s> the government contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two companies three years ago , especially one on aug. 2 , 1995 , which was attended by andrew grove , the intel chairman , and bill gates , the microsoft chairman . </s><s> part of the government 's evidence in the intel-microsoft episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by steven mcgeady , an intel vice president who attended the meetings , and a memo written by him on aug. 28 , 1995 . </s><s> the memo , still under court seal , said that gates `` made vague threats '' and was `` livid '' about intel 's investments in the internet `` and wanted them stopped . '' </s><s> a handwritten note , also under court seal , quotes paul maritz , a microsoft executive , as saying that netscape is their `` common enemy '' and that intel 's role should be to `` fill in stuff in and around microsoft 's strategy . '' </s><s> these documents were sent by intel to the justice department 's office in san francisco in november 1995 , in response to a civil investigative demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on intel on nov. 10 , 1995 . </s><s> on its own , the intel material was intriguing , but it became part of the antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced , one person close to the case said . </s><s> the government is contending that microsoft also tried to urge apple to stop selling its quicktime multimedia software in the windows market and tried to convince real networks inc. to pull back in the market for so-called streaming software . </s><s> the government case has also broadened , people involved in the case say , as more witnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify . </s><s> `` in the beginning , most people in the industry believed that the government would lose and microsoft would retaliate if they came forward , '' one person said . </s><s> `` but as the strength of our case was perceived to improve , more people were willing to come forward , and things snowballed . </s><s> you get intel , it 's easier to get apple and so on .

work camp sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the united states . </s><s> releasing liu nianchun appeared to be an attempt by the government to blunt international criticism over monday 's upcoming trial of prominent dissident xu wenli . </s><s> xu is the third leading member of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion in a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested or interrogated . </s><s> beijing police sunday detained one of xu 's china democracy party colleagues , zha jianguo , to prevent him from attending the trial , xu 's wife

</s><s> his last arrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor rights in may 1995 . </s><s> liu was never put on trial . </s><s> fourteen months passed before his wife , chu hailan , first learned of his fate and whereabouts : a three-year spell in a labor camp in the frigid , remote northeast . </s><s> his term was the maximum police may impose on criminal suspects without trial .

'' </s><s> xu 's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political party , calling for an end to communist rule in interviews with foreign journalists , calling for independent labor unions and , prosecutors said , accepting $ 500 from a dissident abroad . </s><s> he was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court just four days ago and met his client only once . </s><s> also sentenced monday , to 11 years in prison , was wang youcai , 32 , founder of the china democracy party , which has now been suppressed . </s><s> wang was tried on subversion charges on thursday in a brief court session , with no defense lawyer , in the eastern city of hangzhou . </s><s> the punishment of a third veteran democracy campaigner , qin yongmin , 44 , has not been announced . </s><s> his trial began in the central city of wuhan on thursday and may reconvene on tuesday , relatives said . </s><s> a similarly long sentence is expected . </s><s> monday 's sentences , which came just six months after president clinton 's visit to beijing , where he publicly challenged china 's leaders to move quickly toward political reform , were harshly criticized by the state department . </s><s> they also appeared to spell the effective end here of the china democracy party , which these three men , along with hundreds of lesser-known individuals , tried to organize in recent months . </s><s> the long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals here that china 's warming relations with the united states in recent years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring a significant easing of political controls . </s><s> xu was tried monday morning in the beijing intermediate court . </s><s> when after a brief recess the three-judge panel announced his 13-year sentence , xu stood up and shouted , `` i protest ! '' </s><s> said his wife of 28 years , he xintong . </s><s> then , said ms . </s><s> he and lawyers who were present , he shouted that the judges were unfair and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were illegitimate . </s><s> with the sentencing of xu , china 's communist government has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics , one who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy . </s><s> xu first came to prominence during the democracy wall movement of the late 1970s , then served 12 years in prison , much of it in solitary confinement . </s><s> in the last several months , sensing a new opportunity to speak out and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail , he and qin tried to draw attention to china 's obligations under two international covenants it has signed _ one on economic and cultural rights , and one on civil and political rights . </s><s> in the face of several temporary detentions and stiff warnings , they continued their activities . </s><s> wang , in contrast , first became involved in dissident activities in 1989 , while a graduate student in physics in beijing , when he became a leader of the tiananmen square demonstrations . </s><s> after the student movement was smashed by the army , he was on the most-wanted list , then was arrested and spent two years in prison . </s><s> during clinton 's visit to china in june , wang announced the formation of the china democracy party . </s><s> hundreds around the country , including xu and qin , began promoting the idea . </s><s> but while the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year , it has not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the form of organized groups _ to the principle of communist party rule . </s><s> in a speech on friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms , the president and communist party chief , jiang zemin , emphasized the primacy of the party , saying , `` the western mode of political systems must never be adopted . '' </s><s> after learning of monday 's sentences , the american embassy here , which has spent the last two years building improved relations between china and the united states , issued a strong condemnation of what it termed the `` deplorable decisions . '' </s><s> `` we are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences , '' the statement said . </s><s> `` no individual should be arrested , tried and sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms , including those guaranteed in the international covenant on civil and political rights , to which china has committed itself . '' </s><s> like thursday 's trials , both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective lawyers had been warned off by police or detained , monday 's proceeding showed that in cases involving security issues , police and courts could write their own rules . </s><s> according to the criminal procedure law , defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial , but xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be monday . </s><s> his wife , who until monday had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on nov. 30 , was told three days ago . </s><s> under the law , defendants also have the right to a lawyer of their choice , but xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last week . </s><s> before monday morning 's trial , the lawyer , mo shaoping , saw his client only for one brief meeting , an associate of mo 's said . </s><s> xu 's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial . </s><s> `` meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade , '' she said in a telephone interview this weekend . </s><s> responding to the accusations during monday morning 's trial , xu 's lawyer argued that xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state , an associate of the lawyer said . </s><s> but in a decision that was clearly preordained , the court declared xu guilty and sentenced him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in prison . </s><s> born in 1943 in the southeastern province of jiangxi , xu was interested in politics even as a teen-ager , his wife said . </s><s> in the 1960s , as an idealistic marxist , he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend a university . </s><s> he served in the navy for five years , then became an electrician with the beijing railroad before becoming involved with the democracy movement and going to prison . </s><s> on monday afternoon , in a police station hours after the trial finished , xu was allowed a half-hour with his wife . </s><s> `` he told me he 'd be able to handle the pain , '' she later recounted in a telephone interview . </s><s> `` he said that this would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what has happened . '' </s><s> he , who has been married to xu since 1971 , said she expected to see him in monthly visits to prison . </s><s> the couple has a daughter , xu jin , who is a graduate student in fine arts at boston university . </s><s> in an earlier interview , soon after her husband was arrested on nov. 30 , ms . </s><s> he said xu had told her , `` i ca n't change the way i am . '' </s><s> if he received a long sentence , he told his wife , she should go on and enjoy her life . </s><s> `` and if i die , '' xu said as they parted that day , `` please plant a tree for me .
