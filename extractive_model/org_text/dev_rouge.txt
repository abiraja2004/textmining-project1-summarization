cambodia 's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency of parliament with its arch foe saturday , insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body .   disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the cambodian people 's party to form a new government .   cambodian leader hun sen , who heads the cpp , has offered to share the legislature 's top job with the royalist funcinpec party of prince norodom ranariddh in order to break the impasse .   the prince 's party , in a statement dated friday and seen saturday , said such a scenario was unconstitutional .   `` co-sharing anything with the cpp means surrendering full power to them .   furthermore , such a proposal is unconstitutional , '' the faxed statement said .   the royalist party also rejected hun sen 's calls to hold bilateral talks , insisting that ranariddh 's main ally sam rainsy also be included .   `` no party with seats at the national assembly should be left out if transparency and a check and balance system is to be used in government , '' the statement said , adding that the sam rainsy party should also be given chairmanship of one of the national assembly 's nine commissions .   noting that funcinpec allowed the cpp to hold the presidency despite its win in the 1993 general elections , the statement said it was now its turn to take the post .   in the most recent elections , held in july , hun sen 's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats , but was short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government .   fearing arrest , many opposition members of parliament left cambodia after the ceremonial opening of the national assembly on sep. 24 .   a series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed .   the talks have been complicated by the cpp-funcinpec quarrel over the parliament 's top job .   hun sen 's party recently called on ranariddh to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make an `` appropriate concession '' to break the deadlock over forming a government .   funcinpec has demanded from hun sen written guarantees for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for re-entering negotiations .	cambodian party rejects government offer to share legislative office	funcinpec refuses to share presidency with cpp ; says unconstitutional .	disputes over presidency block efforts to form a new government	opposition royalists reject power sharing and talking with cambodian cpp
cambodia 's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman hun sen as sole prime minister , king norodom sihanouk announced .   in a long-elusive compromise , opposition leader prince norodom ranariddh will become president of the national assembly resulting from disputed elections in july , even though hun sen 's party holds a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber .   hun sen 's cambodian people 's party dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by ranariddh and party boss chea sim , the current speaker .   it was one of the main stumbling blocks in months of discord .   instead , sihanouk announced , the constitution will be modified to create a new senate , which chea sim will head .   chea sim will still serve as acting head of state during the king 's frequent absences from the country .   `` the major political crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an end , '' the king said in his statement .   the senate will initially be appointed by the king .   the agreement did not say how many seats there would be , nor how they would be divided .   the parties will hammer out details later .   pok than , one of ranariddh 's negotiators , said the senate would serve a mostly advisory role to the assembly .   the senior senate leaders will join those of the assembly , the prime minister and the country 's top two buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that will choose cambodia 's next king after sihanouk dies .   the two parties said that the assembly would convene again nov. 25 .   the agreement came surprisingly quickly following ranariddh 's return thursday from thailand , where he had been holed up with other opposition figures for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in cambodia .   the deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the cpp and ranariddh 's royalist funcinpec to allow international donors and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country , which is in desperate need of aid .   it could also hasten cambodia 's entry into the association of southeast asian nations , put on hold last year after hun sen deposed ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup .   earlier , as both sides arrived at the royal palace for a second day of meetings , sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form a coalition and made `` important concessions . ''   the king , the sole force in cambodian politics able to broker a deal , pressured both sides to reach agreement before he leaves saturday for medical treatment in beijing .   sihanouk reported that hun sen responded positively to a request by ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political pardons .   all five were convicted of political crimes by courts that are widely seen as loyal to hun sen .   the king has powers to grant pardons , but has awaited agreement from hun sen in politically sensitive cases .   former battlefield enemies , the cpp and funcinpec have been at loggerheads since the cpp narrowly won parliamentary elections in july .   the vote failed to put an end to instability that followed last year 's coup .   the cpp fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government alone .   ranariddh 's party and opposition ally sam rainsy held back their support , claiming the cpp won due to fraud and intimidation .   the opposition organized protests in phnom penh seeking hun sen 's ouster that were violently dispersed .   sam rainsy , under investigation by a phnom penh court for his role in the demonstrations , has remained abroad .   his 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working government .	cambodian king announces coalition government with hun sen as sole premier	hun sen and ranariddh form coalition ; new senate to be formed .	political deadlock broken , hun sen to be cambodia 's prime minister	sihanouk says cambodian government crisis resolved ; parties to share power
cambodian politicians expressed hope monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman hun sen and his rival , prince norodom ranariddh , in a coalition government would not end in more violence .   hun sen and ranariddh , co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 1993 after a landmark u.n.-sponsored election , often clashed over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling khmer rouge .   their arguments turned bloody last year when hun sen ousted ranariddh in a coup .   the prince fled cambodia and did not return until a few months before elections in july .   hun sen 's cambodian people 's party narrowly won the polls , but a strong second-place finish by ranariddh 's funcinpec gave the royalist party leverage in post-election negotiations .   after a three-month impasse , they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make hun sen sole prime minister and ranariddh president of the national assembly .   `` this will not be a repetition of 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers , '' said hun sen aide prak sokhon , who attended last week 's summit .   `` when we had two prime ministers , everything moved very slowly and decisions were made more politically than technically . ''   ranariddh said saturday that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and defense under co-ministers .   senior funcinpec official ahmad yahya revealed monday that it was also agreed that the cpp would control the foreign affairs and finance portfolios .   funcinpec will take justice and information .   the parties are to form working groups this week to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment to form a new senate .   hun sen and ranariddh are scheduled to meet nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results of the working groups and give their final approval , ahmad yahya said .   their ability to repair their relationship and work together will be the key to a stable coalition .   `` i consider this a remarriage , '' ahmad yahya said .   `` they have to be careful with the way they work and what they say .   they will have to compromise to achieve results . ''   ranariddh 's ally , sam rainsy , whose party placed a distant third in the election , was left out of last week 's deal .   sam rainsy , a virulent critic of hun sen , and his party 's 14 other members of parliament have remained outside cambodia since september amid fears for their security .   in a letter to king norodom sihanouk released monday , sam rainsy complained that hun sen had not responded to his queries on security , making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening of parliament .   sam rainsy said he had been told by ranariddh that his party and former khmer rouge guerrillas had been implicated by hun sen in a rocket attack on the sept. 24 opening of parliament .   authorities have called it an assassination attempt on hun sen. a police general investigating the attack said monday that likely suspects have been identified , but he would not reveal names or their political affiliation .	hun sen , prince ranariddh share power in new coalition cambodian government	cambodian coalition formed between hun sen and ranariddh .  rainsy left out .	hope for partnership between hun sen and rival , prince ranariddh	cambodians hope that violence will be avoided in new coalition government

rebel commanders said tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern congo _ a battle that could determine the future of the two-month congolese war .   after trekking several hundred kilometers ( miles ) through dense tropical forest , thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers ( 11 miles ) outside kindu , where troops loyal to president laurent kabila have used an air base as a launching pad for offensives .   if the rebels succeed in capturing kindu , 380 kilometers ( 235 miles ) west of goma , the rebel headquarters , this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest .   a rebel defeat , on the other hand , would put the coalition of ethnic tutsis , disenchanted members of the congolese army and opposition politicians on the defensive and give a boost to kabila 's efforts to fend off the rebellion launched aug. 2 .   rebel commander richard mondo said troops had fired artillery rounds into kindu monday and early tuesday , sending the population fleeing out of town .   advance units had crossed the lualaba river from the north and were meeting stiff resistance in the town , he said .   since the assault on the town began at 3 a.m. ( 0100 gmt ) , at least 18 enemy soldiers were killed and 40 taken prisoner , mondo said , adding the number was expected to rise .   the rebels took casualties , too , but the number was not known .   one rebel soldier was wounded in the stomach , he said .   he said the large kindu air base , 4 kilometers ( 2 miles ) outside town , was deserted and no one appeared to be in control .   `` our soldiers are in the town and the fighting is continuing , '' rebel battalion commander arthur mulunda said in kalima , 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) northeast of kindu .   there was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims .   on sunday , a spokesman in goma boasted that kindu was already under rebel control .   in kinshasa , government spokesman didier mumengi said monday the congolese army was firmly in control of kindu .   mulunda 's 1,500-strong battalion walked 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) bukavu at the southern end of lake kivu to kalima , which fell to the rebels saturday with little resistance .   the rebel fighters , clad in brand-new rwandan-made dark green uniforms , rubber rain boots and toting kalashnikov assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers , said they were advancing slowly through the lush forest of palm trees and razor-sharp tall grass .   `` we 've been resting a lot .   it took us two weeks to get here , '' mondo said .   the rebels are now using kalima , a town with one main street , scattered houses and mud-and-brick huts , to supply troops with rice , cooking oil , drinking water and ammunition .   a small , grass airstrip 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) away from kalima is just barely long enough for the rebels ' russian-built antonov an-72 transport aircraft .   the rebels have targeted kindu since late august , when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of kinshasa after angola and zimbabwe sent troops to bail out kabila .   rebels still control a string of towns in eastern congo , including kisangani , the country 's third-largest city .	battle for kindu critical for anti-kabila congo rebels	rebels ready to take strategic airbase .  thousands are outside kindu .	rebels prepare to attack essential government supply air base near kindu	battle over government-held base could determine future of war in congo
a day after shooting down a jetliner carrying 40 people , rebels clashed with government troops near a strategic airstrip in eastern congo on sunday .   fighting for the town of kindu in this vast west african nation subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield , two miles ( three kilometers ) away .   on saturday , the rebels shot down a congolese boeing 727 over the kindu airport .   rescue workers said there were no survivors from the downed plane , the british broadcasting corp. reported sunday .   rebels said the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition .   in the capital , kinshasa , the private congolese airlines , which owned the aircraft , said the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in kindu .   it was not possible to confirm either claim independently .   rebel commander fino kabangu kalunga said surface-to-air missiles in the arsenal of his congolese democratic coalition had prevented the government from landing aircraft at the airport .   kabangu kalunga said 3,500 rebel troops and their rwandan allies had closed in on government forces from three directions after a week of fighting .   he said government troops did not launch a counterattack to sunday 's barrage , and some reportedly retreated on the one road leading out of town .   the rebels say they now control one-third of kindu , which the government has used as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in the east .   rebels , who began their insurgency more than two months ago , accuse president laurent kabila of corruption , failing to carry out promised democratic reforms , and stirring up hatred among congo 's 400 tribes .   early in the conflict , rebels pushed far into the west , to the outskirts of congo 's capital .   then angola , zimbabwe and namibia intervened to help kabila and drove the rebels back to their bases in eastern congo .   the conflict has drawn in many of congo 's neighbors .   there are unconfirmed reports that troops from chad and the sudan are involved in defending kindu .   kabila accuses rwanda and uganda _ former allies who installed him in power in may 1997 after an eight-month rebellion _ of sponsoring the rebels .   both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern congo and accuse kabila of failing to rid the common border area of rwandan and ugandan rebels .	congo rebels control third of kindu , but outcome not clear	fighting for kindu and airfield subsides after rebel artillery strikes .	passengers killed in plane shot down ; unclear if soldiers or civilians	fighting in congo slows day after rebel downed jetliner carrying 40 people
blood and soot-blackened water ran in rivulets from the charred wreckage .   a burly policeman bent to cover a bloodied corpse with whatever was at hand _ a sodden piece of cardboard , a plastic shopping bag .   two people were killed and at least 21 injured when an explosives-rigged car blew up friday at jerusalem 's mahane yehuda market , only meters ( yards ) from the site of a suicide bombing 16 months ago .   at police barricades set up along jerusalem 's busiest thoroughfare , soldiers and police held back crowds of people , some frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded market only hours before the start of the jewish sabbath .   `` please , please , is there a girl with red hair who is hurt ? ''   an older , heavyset woman said tearfully , trying to push her way past police .   a young female soldier patted her arm consolingly .   some of the onlookers gave vent to fury over the new peace agreement , which was being debated by israel 's cabinet even as the blast occurred .   `` death to arabs !   death to arafat ! ''   a small crowd of demonstrators shouted .   police tried to grab one of them , but he escaped into the crowd .   the explosives-rigged car was a mass of twisted metal , with only the steering column intact .   next to the wreckage lay a completely charred body with stumps of arms and legs _ apparently that of the bomber .   witnesses said they heard a series of explosions .   although shop windows closest to the car were shattered , market stalls only a few more feet ( yards ) away were completely intact , and stacked with neat piles of bananas and onions .   eyewitness yaakov shlomo said initial , smaller blasts scared most onlookers away .   `` when the big explosion went , there were already not that many people nearby , '' he said .   `` that was a miracle from heaven . ''   shlomo meir , a black-clad orthodox jew , was standing nearby when he heard a blast .   when he tuirned he saw fire .   `` it was terrible , '' he said , red-eyed .   `` i thought , `again ! ' ''   only a block away , some stalls were still open and shoppers were buying produce .   one woman , with almost maniacal determination , sorted through a pile of oranges .   `` we ca n't stop what we 're doing when this happens , '' she said grimly .   by the police barricades , wearing bright-orange vests , stood a group of orthodox jewish volunteers who search scenes of accidents and attacks for body parts , in keeping with their religious belief that bodies must be buried intact .   one young volunteer squinted down the street as his group waited for permission to begin its grisly task .   `` it 's hard , this work , but it 's very important to us , '' he said .	car bomb leaves carnage in jerusalem market ; 2 killed , 21 injured	2 killed , at least 21 hurt in market bombing ; onlookers frantic , furious .	police hold back crowds looking for relatives in jerusalem market bombing	car blast kills 2 , injures over 21 in jerusalem 's mahane yehuda market .

with attorneys locked up , harassed or plain scared , two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion thursday in china 's highest-profile dissident trials in two years .   qin yongmin 's and wang youcai 's families were running out of options wednesday to help the pair , leading organizers of a budding opposition political party .   qin 's family pleaded for a postponement at wuhan 's intermediate people 's court , but court officials denied the request .   police have detained one lawyer and threatened another , and subtler pressures have been used on others , family members said .   given the interference , wang youcai 's wife assumes he will be convicted .   `` whether he has a lawyer or not , whatever he says , the government has already decided , '' hu jiangxia said .   qin and wang will be tried separately , in cities 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) apart and in proceedings attended only by family and a few observers selected by the courts .   qin , 44 , and wang , 31 , are accused of inciting the subversion of state power , apparently for helping to organize the china democracy party .   they face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspects of the law .   by moving against qin , wang and the china democracy party , the ruling communist party appears to be signaling its determination to crush challenges to its monopoly on power .   authorities have detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the party in a 17-day-old crackdown .   qin , a democracy campaigner for 20 years , and wang , a student leader of the 1989 tiananmen square democracy movement , are among the most active and influential members of china 's dissident community .   a third prominent member of the dissident community , xu wenli , was also arrested in the crackdown , but not yet charged .   to prevent displays of solidarity outside wang 's trial , police have detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of hangzhou , a hong kong-based rights group reported .   the information center of human rights and democratic movement in china said many more are missing and believed to be in custody .   to prosecute wang , authorities violated the minimal rights guaranteed suspects under chinese law and ignored court orders , his wife said .   `` even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer , but while i was doing this , some people were doing things to stop me , '' hu jiangxia said .   during one meeting with a potential defense attorney , a police official stormed in and said , `` `do n't do anything for them .   do n't take this case .   whoever takes the case , you ca n't win , ' '' hu recounted .   four law firms refused to take qin 's case , his brother qin xiaoguang said .   the information center said one lawyer who initially agreed to represent qin on monday went missing for four hours and then called qin 's family to withdraw .   dispirited by the harsh treatment , qin 's family argued over whether to attend the trial .   qin xiaoguang said he and his father have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness , but another brother will go .   three dissidents from northeastern china sent an open letter to china 's legislature and the supreme people 's court appealing for fair trials , the information center said .   it added that authorities violated china 's own laws by not ensuring wang and qin have adequate representation .   the letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstrating the appeal of both wang and qin and the idea of the china democracy party .   since wang publicly announced in june that he and others in hangzhou were setting up the party , dissidents in at least 14 provinces and cities have set up party branches .   authorities have refused their applications to register the party as required by law .   wang and qin are the most well-known dissidents china has put on trial since tiananmen square student leader wang dan in 1996 .   he was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year sentence .   in return for his release , he agreed to go into exile .	potential lawyers for chinese dissidents jailed or intimidated	unable to get lawyers , two prominent dissidents will defend themselves	police scare off lawyers ; dissidents forced to defend themselves in trial	two chinese democracy activists to defend selves , face certain conviction
this is what newt gingrich is supposed to do well .   the planning .   the strategy .   the big picture .   the vision .   his vision brought the gop to the majority in congress in 1994 and made him the first republican house speaker in 40 years .   but by his own admission , gingrich 's vision seems to have blurred this time around , costing republicans a net of five seats in tuesday 's election and leaving the party 's narrow governing majority even narrower .   the disappointing election results also left gingrich open to a fractious challenge for his post as speaker .   members and aides said wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled up overnight and that some members were trying to organize a slate of candidates to replace gingrich and his leadership team when house republicans convene on nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year .   as rep. mark sanford , r-s.c. , put it , `` when a company 's stock price goes down , it 's usually the ceo who gets fired . ''   top republican aides , speaking anonymously , were even blunter .   `` people were very angry last night , '' one aide said .   `` today it 's a mixture of seething and dismay .   it 's just ugly .   and newt knows it .   his career is on the line . ''   another aide said , `` most people are really angry with newt , and no one knows what to do with it .   but some are dipping their toe in the water and seeing what the temperature is . ''   a possible slate could contain the names of reps. robert l. livingston of louisiana to replace gingrich , steve largent of oklahoma to replace dick armey of texas as majority leader , and jennifer dunn of washington to replace john a. boehner of ohio as conference chairman .   rep. david m. mcintosh of indiana is also said to be considering a run for speaker , but it was not clear whether he would be part of any slate .   rep. tom delay of texas , the majority whip , was said to be secure .   armey bluntly acknowledged the scramble going on in the wings to oust the leadership .   told on `` nightline '' that there were republicans after his head , armey replied : `` they 're welcome to it if they 're big enough to take it . ''   publicly , gingrich has expressed confidence about keeping his job as speaker .   but he has been grim-faced over the last 24 hours and closeted himself wednesday with his top strategists making calls to shore up his support among members .   `` he looks like the victim of an accident , '' said rep. peter king , r-n.y. , who supports gingrich .   `` he 's very somber in tone . ''   the question , as it always is with gingrich , is how many members are prepared to rebel against his leadership .   in the past , no more than a couple of dozen members have openly expressed their dissatisfaction with him , and a coup attempt last year fizzled for lack of support .   `` i 'm hoping more people will understand the need for a serious reassessment this year , '' said rep. charles t. canady , r-fla. , who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker after the 1996 elections , when the republicans also lost seats .   `` the reality is this : our majority keeps shrinking , '' canady said .   `` if it shrinks any more , it will be gone . ''   but gingrich has built support among moderates , and some perceived the election as a repudiation of the conservatives .   rep. sherwood l. boehlert , r-utah , said the results showed that this was the right direction for the party .   `` to maintain our majority , we 've got to moderate some of our views , '' boehlert said .   thomas mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution , said that moderates supported gingrich in part because no appealing alternative had emerged .   `` they know he sees the broader world and is prepared to moderate if it makes sense , '' mann said .   `` newt 's gone out of his way to support the moderates .   he 's nurtured a relationship with them . ''   but mann and others said that anger has been building at gingrich for several reasons , including his signing on to a budget deal last month that seemed to capitulate to president clinton , not offering a clear legislative agenda for republicans and not communicating a clear political message .   `` we are most defined by who we hate '' said rep. mark souder , r-ind .   `` but voters are more sophisticated than that , and republicans better have something to say about where we 're going . ''   the anger grew in the last few days when the speaker approved a $ 10-million anti-clinton advertising campaign that allowed democrats to turn the election into a referendum on gingrich , who has never been nearly as popular with the public as clinton has been .   as if only slowly absorbing the implications of the loss , the speaker seemed unable at a news conference here wednesday morning to pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seats in the house .   as late as tuesday afternoon , he was predicting a net pickup of between 10 and 30 .   `` until we look at it better , i frankly do n't understand all the things that happened yesterday , '' he said , `` and i 'm not sure anybody else in the country does either . ''   but he said republicans should have `` maniacally focused '' on a basic message of cutting taxes , saving social security and preventing drug abuse , and campaigned aggressively on those themes .   he contrasted the lack of focus this year with the contract with america that proved so successful in 1994 .   `` people thought we stood for something pretty big , '' he said .   but gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about his leadership , repeatedly casting the election results as a victory for his leadership team because republicans had stayed in the majority for three elections in a row for the first time in 70 years .   he also suggested that those who would challenge him have little support .   `` the people who normally are quoted on this are people who would in fact take the party to a narrower base , '' gingrich said , referring to the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives about his leadership .   `` i 'd like to see who it was that had a plan that they were confident over the last 60 days would have been more successful and why they did n't share it .

america online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase netscape communications corp. , the internet pioneer at the center of the government 's antitrust suit against microsoft corp. , executives involved in the talks said sunday .   the proposed deal is a complex , three-way transaction involving aol , netscape and sun microsystems inc. aol , the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers , would acquire netscape 's popular site on the world wide web and its software business .   but as part of the deal , aol would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with sun microsystems to strengthen netscape 's other business of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up web pages and other internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time .   the purchase , an exchange of aol shares for netscape stock , is valued at roughly $ 4 billion .   a completed deal could be announced as soon as monday morning .   but executives involved in the talks cautioned sunday night that some details remained to be negotiated .   the netscape deal , if consummated , would realign three businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services , internet software and electronic commerce .   it would strengthen two of microsoft 's leading rivals , aol and sun microsystems .   at the same time , however , it would subsume netscape , an internet software maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to microsoft 's dominance of the personal computer software market .   netscape , founded in 1994 , has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from microsoft .   its navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the world wide web .   but microsoft , responding to the internet revolution , entered the market aggressively , quickly matching the quality of netscape 's technology and then bundling the microsoft browser , internet explorer , into its industry-standard windows operating system and giving it away free .   earlier this year , netscape announced layoffs and started distributing navigator for free as well , as microsoft steadily gained in the browser market .   since then , netscape has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction fees from its netcenter web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporations that are building their own internet sites on which to conduct electronic commerce .   aol believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from netscape 's web site and , helped by sun 's programmers and vast corporate sales force , to accelerate netscape 's software sales as well , executives involved in the negotiations said .   sun 's version of unix , solaris , is among the most popular operating systems for the large , powerful computers that run netscape 's server software .   `` this deal would insure that the fundamental elements of netscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its technologies forward , '' said david b. yoffie , a professor at the harvard business school and co-author with michael a. cusumano of the massachusetts institute of technology of a recent book , `` competing on internet time : lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft . ''   the impact of the deal , if any , on the government 's antitrust suit against microsoft is uncertain .   it does appear to support a key theme of microsoft 's defense _ namely , that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time .   thus , microsoft argues , antitrust policy should tread gently .   but the deal , government officials insist , should have no direct effect on the current case .   `` no matter how much the alliances shift , it does n't affect the central fact of microsoft 's monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect its monopoly , '' said david boies , the justice department 's lead trial lawyer in the microsoft case .   executives representing netscape , aol and sun microsystems are government witnesses at the microsoft trial .   and the serious merger talks between netscape chief executive officer james barksdale and aol chairman steve case began about a month ago , or just after the start of the microsoft trial , according to people close to the talks .   industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been emboldened to take stronger anti-microsoft steps based partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken microsoft .   and representatives of kleiner perkins caufield & amp ; byers , a silicon valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among microsoft 's rivals , sit on the boards of netscape , sun and aol .	proposed aol purchase of netscape would strengthen microsoft 's rivals	aol seeks to purchase netscape in move to counter rival microsoft	aol intends to buy netscape and develop partnership with sun microsystems	aol reportedly to purchase netscape , enter partnership with sun
ukraine 's parliament on friday refused to approve president leonid kuchma 's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks .   deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month .   they must consider the decree by oct. 10 , or else it automatically takes effect under the constitution .   leftist factions , which voted against the proposed legislation , said it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lost during the financial instability that has recently hit ukraine .   the fund kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated money in a special national bank account and repay people in case the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent .   although the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting only to 500 hryvna ( dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate ) , its authors said it would cover more than 90 percent of ukrainians who keep their money in banks .   the measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals of deposits that most ukrainian banks have already experienced as people , scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil in neighboring russia , started to stock up on food , clothing and household goods .   government officials say that ukrainians have recently withdrawn at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna ( dlrs 882 million ) they deposited in banks .	ukraine parliament decisively rejects decree of president kuchma	plan to restore lost savings turned down by ukrainian government	ukraine parliament rejects state fund compensation for bank savings losses	ukraine govt looks for ways to keep money in banks ; discourage stockpiling
turkey has sent 10,000 troops to its southeastern border with syria amid growing tensions between the two neighbors , newspapers reported thursday .   the daily milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer ( 375-mile ) border ; the daily cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops were being deployed .   defense minister ismet sezgin denied any troop movement along the border , but said turkey 's patience was running out .   president suleyman demirel was harsher during parliament 's opening session thursday .   `` i declare to the world that we retain our right to counter syria , which has not given up its hostile attitude despite all our warnings and peaceful approaches , '' he said .   turkey accuses syria of harboring turkish kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in turkey 's southeast ; it says rebel leader abdullah ocalan lives in damascus .   relations are also strained by the growing military and diplomatic ties between turkey and israel , which damascus claims destabilizes the region .	turkey sends troops to syrian border protesting aid to kurdish rebels	as tensions with syria grow , turkey sends troops to border area	turkey sends 10,000 troops to syrian border as tensions rise	turkey moving troops to syrian border claiming it 's kurdish rebels haven
leading maxi yachts brindabella , sayonara and marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the new south wales state coast saturday as the sydney to hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather .   all three maxis reported in at the same latitude during saturday night 's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical miles south of jervis bay on the new south wales south coast .   american maxi sayonara and sydney boat brindabella reported they were about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) offshore while marchioness was a couple of miles further inshore .   in fourth spot was australian maxi wild thing .   the three leaders covered 105 nautical miles in the first 7 1-2 hours of the race .   propelled for the most part by favorable northerly breezes , the leaders rocketed along at an average speed of 14 knots in the first part of the 630-nautical-mile race to hobart on the island state of tasmania .   the fast early pace put the leaders well on schedule to eclipse morning glory 's 1996 race record but that was before the far tougher conditions forecast for overnight saturday night .   morning glory , a german maxi , broke the 21-year-old race record two years ago , arriving in hobart 2 days , 14 hours , seven minutes and 10 seconds after she left sydney .   while the annual event started in friendly and favorable northeasterly breezes , the 115-strong fleet reported cloudier conditions as it moved down the coast .   the yachts were bracing for a tough night with thunderstorms predicted ahead of a west-southwesterly change expected to lash the south coast by sunday morning .   earlier , a crowd of around 300,000 people on the sydney headlands and water witnessed the start of the annual blue water classic .   sayonara took the initial honors when she beat brindabella though sydney heads , but the 1997 line honors winner drew level when the american maxi 's spinnaker blew out and had to be replaced .	maxis brindabella , sayonara and marchioness lead sydney-to-hobart race	three yachts tied for lead as weather deteriorates in sydney to hobart race	brindabella , sayonara , marchioness in close race .  weather deteriorating .	brindabella , sayonara , marchioness lead race in record breaking pace
two yacht crew members are dead , three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the sydney-to-hobart race fleet .   a helicopter rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical miles off the far south new south wales town of merimbula early monday morning .   two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel business post naiad were left behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard the helicopter and flown to merimbula hospital , he said .   the deaths were confirmed by an australian search and rescue coordination center spokesman in canberra a short time later .   neither organization was able to say how the sailors died or give details on the injuries suffered by surviving crewmen .   three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor swept off the sword of orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on sunday night .   the missing boats are veteran cutter winston churchill , which sailed in the inaugural 1945 race , b-52 and solo globe challenger .   a major search involving australia 's navy continued monday morning for those missing .   race spokesman peter campbell said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water .   `` it 's supposition .   we had john quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe conditions , '' campbell said .   despite the horrendous conditions it was unlikely the race would be called off , he said .   `` it does say in the instructions that it is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the race or retires , '' he said .   the australian maritime safety authority ( amsa ) has alerted all shipping in bass strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet .   an amsa spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot sydney yacht sword of orion had rolled in heavy seas near gabo island about 450 kilometers ( 280 miles ) east of melbourne .   several crewmen were injured including one with a broken leg .   the yacht , which has a crew of 11 , was halfway across bass strait when it overturned .   the navy sent a sea king helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate hmas newcastle was on its way to the area .   earlier , as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet caused havoc to the fleet , several rescues took place .   a police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the victorian yacht kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south of gabo island .   john campbell , an american , was in the water for about 40 minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to safety by senior constable barry barclay , who dropped into large swells to secure campbell .   a total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race , many having been dismasted or suffering injuries to crew .   meanwhile , american maxi sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year 's line winner brindabella .   although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed , they were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 2 days , 14 hours , seven minutes and 10 seconds set by german maxi morning glory in 1996 .

making their first collective decision about monetary policy , the 11 european nations launching a common currency on jan. 1 cut interest rates thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence .   ten of the 11 countries joining european economic union dropped their key interest rate to 3 percent , with portugal making the most significant plunge , from 3.75 percent .   austria made the smallest cut , from 3.2 percent .   the exception was italy , which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent .   it is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is launched .   unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the groundwork for monetary union , and analysts generally expected rates to settle at around the level of germany 's , 3.3 percent before the cut , now 3 percent .   however , interest rate levels had become a contentious political issue with center-left governments in germany and france pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment , stuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro .   the head of the european central bank that will set monetary policy for the euro nations , wim duisenberg , again on thursday suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs , and not pressure him to cut rates .   the remarks in brussels _ before the cuts were made _ gave no hint that a rate drop was imminent , but made clear his resistance to political pressure was as strong as ever .   so strong , in fact , that dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he had feared the bank would delay the decision .   `` what had been feared was that , in order to prove its independence , the ecb would go against its own analysis and would wait longer , which would have been nonsensical , '' zalm said .   hans tietmeyer , who runs the german bundesbank on which the ecb is modeled , hinted the rate cut was designed to boost confidence in the new currency , dampened by global economic crises and europe 's worsening outlook .   `` the coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence , '' tietmeyer said .   the cuts seemed to have the desired impact .   frankfurt 's main index closed up 2.1 percent , while france 's was up 1.8 percent .   the cuts also boosted markets in spain , belgium , italy and even britain , which is not among the nations launching the euro .   `` the reaction is , `oh good , they 're doing a little bit to prop up the euro economy . '   but confidence has taken quite a hit across europe recently , and i think further action from the ecb will be needed next year , maybe down to 2.5 percent , '' james mitchell , senior london-based strategist with nomura .   an economist at the banque bruxelles lambert , liesbeth van de craen , said the cuts were timely .   `` we are clearly headed for a slowdown , '' she said .   until recently , europe 's economies had held out relatively well against damage from asia and russia 's economic crises and unstable financial markets .   but just two days ago , duisenberg painted the bleakest picture yet of europe 's economies , warning growth will likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from earlier expectations of 3 percent .   the rate cuts may help .   by making it cheaper to borrow money , rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses , making it less worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend .   that expands the economy .   the 11 countries launching the euro are austria , belgium , ireland , italy , finland , france , germany , luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and portugal .	lower interest rates intended to boost confidence in euro	surprise cut in interest rates seen as critical step for monetary union	eleven european nations cut interest rates , win market confidence in euro	euro-nations drop interest rates to 3 % ; markets respond well to timely act .
turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day monday to secure the release of an italian inmate held hostage to pressure italy into extraditing a kurdish rebel leader , a prosecutor said .   the italian , mario calascibetta , was taken hostage sunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader yasar oz , to push for the return to turkey of rebel leader abdullah ocalan , turkey 's most-wanted man .   ocalan is currently being held in rome .   calascibetta , imprisoned in istanbul 's metris jail since his detention in august , was due to be handed over to swiss police monday .   he is wanted for questioning in switzerland in connection with a killing .   turkey 's anatolia news agency said oz was determined not to free his hostage until italy agreed to turkey 's demand to send back ocalan who is turkey 's most wanted man .   `` he is not in any life threatening danger .   we are not alarmed for his safety , '' said prosecutor celil demircioglu .   `` the negotiations are continuing , we believe he will be freed very soon . ''   demircioglu said calascibetta 's extradition would now be delayed by a few days .   he denied turkish press reports that the italian was being held at gun point .   oz is currently on trial on drugs-related charges .   the mob has often supported right-wing parties and ultranationalist causes .   at a time when the state is under pressure to crack down on the mob , it seemed convenient for oz to show he was backing the government 's cause .	in turkish prison , mob leader takes italian prisoner hostage to get ocalan .	turks negotiate for release of italian hostage help by kurdish inmates	turkey negotiates with prison mob leader for release of italian inmate	right-wing prisoners in turkey hold italian to trade for kurdish leader .
it was new highs again for the standard & amp ; poor 's 500-stock and nasdaq composite indexes friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers and a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound pushed stocks up .   oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between exxon and mobil on a merger that would create the world 's largest oil company .   internet and computer stocks also rallied , helped in part by the announcement on tuesday of america online 's purchase of netscape communications in a three-way deal involving sun microsystems .   at the same time , germany 's deutsche bank and bankers trust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on monday .   `` there is no question that the merger euphoria is the headline , '' said hugh johnson , chief investment officer at the first albany corp. `` but the flow into mutual funds is also strong .

house speaker-elect robert l. livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against president clinton on thursday night as the republican leader was forced to admit to his republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past .   `` it has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals working together with the media who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment , '' livingston declared in a statement after appearing before a shocked house republican conference to head off the disclosure as it surfaced in news reports .   after hearing his admissions in a closed session , livingston 's colleagues gave him a standing ovation of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen .   `` my fate is in your hands , '' livingston told the republicans , according to lawmakers who were present .   the debate over the president 's fate would go forward , republicans later insisted , drawing distinctions between the speaker-elect 's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that has put clinton on the brink of impeachment .   the president is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions .   democrats offered no immediate comment , but republicans were braced to hear livingston 's admissions alluded to in the debate friday by democrats who have decried the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his sex life .   livingston , saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family , noted he had several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker that `` i was running for speaker , not sainthood . ''   he added , `` there was a reason for those words . ''   `` during my 33-year marriage to my wife , bonnie , i have on occasion strayed from my marriage , and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family , '' livingston said in his brief prepared statement .   but he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations against the president , asserting : `` i want to assure everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and i have never been asked to testify under oath about them . ''   the disclosure of the speaker-elect 's marital infidelities , disclosed in `` rollcall , '' a capitol hill newspaper , sent a new jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the president 's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the senate .   rep. henry hyde , the republican chairman of the house judiciary committee who is to bring the impeachment charges against the president , previously was cited by a magazine for an extra-marital affair in his past .   then , as on thursday night , republicans voiced suspicions that democratic defenders of the president instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the clinton 's principal accusers .   but no proof was offered as republicans left their conference , facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised to be bare-knuckled in its partisanship .   livingston left the conference surrounded by capitol police , not taking questions from waiting reporters .   his chief leadership aides immediately rallied in support .   `` some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private lives , '' said rep. dick armey , the republican majority leader .   in its report on the internet thursday night , rollcall did not disclose its source but made an oblique reference to hustler , the sex magazine .   larry flint , publisher of hustler , earlier this year advertised an offer of a $ 1 million bounty for information about e of members of congress guilty of sexual indiscretions .   `` it breaks your heart because we 're all subject to human frailties , '' said asa hutchinson , r-ark. , as he left the conference .   `` this is not a comfortable circumstance for anyone , '' he added , insisting the president and the speaker-elect presented two separate issues .   `` we 've got a duty to do under the constitution .

in the end , the will of the people meant nothing .   bob livingston could n't have been clearer about that .   his mind and the minds of his followers were closed .   even as the bombing continued in iraq and americans from coast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment , even as his own adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque invasions of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient pursuit of the president , even as the country began to contemplate the destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter senate trial , the speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed : `` let us disregard the outside influences . ''   the radicals on the hill would hear nothing but the echoes of their own fanaticism .   impeach !   impeach !   and that continued even after the stunning announcement saturday morning that livingston would quit the house .   dismayed by the partisan stampede , dick gephardt , the democratic leader , warned during the impeachment debate on friday : `` in your effort to uphold the constitution , you are trampling the constitution . ''   david bonior , the democratic whip , said : `` this is wrong .   it is unfair .   it is unjust .   at a time when events in the world and the challenges at home demand that we stand united , censure is the one solution that can bring us together .   to my colleagues across the aisle , i say let go of your obsession .   listen to the american people . ''   but the voices of reason would not be heard .   livingston and his right-wing colleagues , the tom delays , the henry hydes , the bob barrs , were on a mission of destruction and would not be denied .   ordinary americans could cry out all they wanted .   they could protest and demonstrate , send faxes and e-mails .   it did n't matter .   the right was on the march and democracy was on the run .   rep. thomas barrett , a democrat from wisconsin , tried to remind his republican colleagues that the constitution `` does not allow you to remove a president from office because you ca n't stand him . ''   he was , of course , ignored .   the republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen , utterly partisan attempt to drag a president from the white house in defiance of the will of the people .   the party 's contempt for the voters was arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by alan simpson , the former senator from wyoming , who said : `` the attention span of americans is which movie is coming out next month and whether the quarterly report on their stock will change . ''   if the voters are the dopes that mr. simpson thinks they are , then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten there was an impeachment crisis .   but rep. robert menendez , d-n.j. , was probably closer to the truth when he said , `` i warn my colleagues that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today . ''   one of the many strange events of the past couple of weeks was the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided republicans , the so-called moderates , surrendered their independence and lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing 's lead .   all proclaimed loudly that they were voting on principle , but in fact it was an exercise in mass cowardice , exemplified by rep. john mchugh of upstate new york .   mchugh announced on tuesday that he would vote for impeachment .   but if his decision was based on principle , he had an odd way of expressing it .   the washington post said mchugh appeared to have no stomach for a senate conviction or removal of the president from office .   of his colleagues in the senate , mchugh said , `` i , for one , would accept , even welcome , their mercy . ''   in other words , let the senate do the heavy constitutional lifting .   mchugh may have wished out loud for mercy , but he clearly was too frightened of the right-wingers in the house to cast a compassionate vote himself .   the gop can no longer conceal that it is a party of extremists , of right-wing absolutists , a party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of most americans .   bob livingston may be leaving , but his arrogant comment can still serve as his party 's slogan .   `` let us disregard the outside influences .

two astronauts ventured back out on another spacewalk wednesday to attach antennas to the international space station under construction nearly 250 miles above earth .   for the second time this week , jerry ross and james newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle endeavour to work on the seven-story , 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay .   their no .   1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas to unity , the american-made side of the space station .   their other job , time permitting , was trickier : trying to open a stuck antenna on zarya , the russian-built control module .   the planned seven-hour spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or crucial as monday night 's outing , during which ross and newman hooked up 40 electrical connections between zarya and unity .   the plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size antennas about halfway up unity and install them on opposite sides of the 36-foot cylinder .   once activated , the antennas will provide a direct , virtually uninterrupted communication link between unity and nasa 's mission control .   otherwise , u.s. flight controllers would have to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by russian ground stations .   the electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be made inside unity on thursday , after the entire crew enters the orbiting station for the first time .   other spacewalking chores for ross and newman on wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of unity .   mission control decided just before the spacewalk to let newman take a crack at unjamming the zarya antenna .   flight controllers urged caution .   the antenna was rolled up on a spool , and engineers worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough force to hurt him if he got too close .   newman had a 10-foot grappling hook for the job .   the antenna is one of two that failed to open properly following zarya 's nov. 20 launch from kazakstan .   one more spacewalk is planned for endeavour 's 12-day mission : on saturday , ross and newman will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors .   newman also may try to unjam the other zarya antenna .   this was the sixth spacewalk for ross during his 18-year nasa career , the most by an american , and the third for newman .	2 endeavor astronauts go on 2nd spacewalk to work on space station modules .	astronauts to install antennas on unity chamber , fix russian antenna	2nd 2-man spacewalk to attach unity antennas , open stuck zarya antenna	astronauts , newman , ross , attach antennas , 40 electrical connections
the first piece of the international space station was orbiting earth friday , sprouting antennae and unfolding solar power panels as it awaited other segments , which will eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history .   the module , called zarya from the russian term meaning sunrise or dawn , took a flawless ride into space atop a three-stage russian proton booster rocket that lifted off at 1:40 a.m. eastern time from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan .   the launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the 16 nations that are sponsoring the station , which will cost at least $ 40 billion to build over the next five years .   zarya , built in russia with $ 240 million from the united states , is to be joined in two weeks by the first american module , a docking hub called unity .   the space shuttle endeavour is to take off on dec. 3 to rendezvous with zarya and attach the two units .   this is to be followed by 43 more flights by american and russian rockets carrying more than 100 parts to be assembled in space to form a 900,000-pound research station housing up to seven astronauts .   daniel goldin , the administrator of nasa , said at a news conference following the launching , `` now we only have 44 launches to go , about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems . ''   but because of all the partner nations trusting each other and working together , he said , `` the international space station is going to be a reality . ''   even as the new space station is coming together , questions continue about the fate of russia 's existing space laboratory , the 12-year-old mir .   because of the collapse of the russian economy , doubts that russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment to support both projects led russia to promise that it would abandon mir and destroy the station by next summer .   however , in recent weeks russian officials have been lobbying to find ways to extend mir 's life .   according to a report by the news agency reuters , president boris yeltsin 's space adviser , yevgeny shaposhnikov , said friday he was preparing a number of proposals on extending mir 's life past the year 2000 .   support for such options has been growing in recent weeks among russian space officials , astronauts and nationalists , who see mir as a symbol of russian achievements in space .   james van laak , nasa 's deputy manager of operations for the space station , said friday that the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending mir 's life .   `` nasa would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has any measurable impact on the international space station , '' van laak said in a telephone interview from the johnson space center in houston , `` no one has any objection to mir or keeping it operational if the russians find a way to support both projects , but they have to demonstrate they can . ''   yuri koptev , head of the russian space agency , said the launching of zarya , a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction , was a needed vindication for the troubled russian space program .   `` the russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station , '' koptev said .	russia 's zarya in orbit ; will be joined by u.s .  unity module in 2 weeks .	first piece of space station in orbit , awaiting american launch	russia looking to extend mir 's life after promise to abandon and destroy it	zarya , international space station , mir $ 240 million from the u.s .
president fernando henrique cardoso 's efforts to repair the largest economy in latin america may depend on the outcome of this weekend 's gubernatorial elections .   cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in brazil 's economy and restore investor confidence .   but his plan , expected to be unveiled next week , must be approved by congress , and state governors have enormous sway over local delegations .   `` the influence governors have on their congressional blocs is overwhelming , '' said university of sao paulo political scientist eduardo kugelmas .   brazil has been caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year ago in southeast asia .   as wary investors have fled its financial markets , brazil 's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of july .   on sunday , voters return to the polls for runoff elections in 12 states and in the federal district of brasilia .   the outcome will likely determine how successful cardoso is in getting congress to approve his economic program , which is aimed at trimming the budget deficit .   new income , fuel and bank transaction taxes are expected to be proposed .   kugelmas said opponents of the president stand a good chance of winning in four large states _ sao paulo , minas gerais , rio de janeiro and rio grande do sul .   `` if they win , the president will face a tough uphill battle , '' he said .   cardoso needs the governors ' support not only in influencing the congressional delegations , but also in holding down their own spending .   `` the problem is that none of the candidates in sunday 's elections ... wants to be identified with unpopular austerity measures , '' said kugelmas .   `` so they promise to spend more money on schools , hospitals and public work projects . ''   sao paulo , brazil 's industrial and financial powerhouse , is perhaps the state most critical to the success of cardoso 's austerity plans .   with more than 34 million inhabitants , nearly equal to the entire population of neighboring argentina , it alone accounts for more than one-third of brazil 's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seats .   while incumbent governor mario covas , a cardoso ally who is seeking re-election , has committed himself to the austerity plan , covas opponent paulo maluf is a question mark .   `` if maluf wins , he will use his victory as a launching pad to the presidency in 2003 , '' kugelmas predicted .   `` and that means he will try to stay as far away as possible from any austerity measure .

the united states is preparing to commit u.s. taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $ 30 billion to try to insulate brazil , and with it the rest of latin america , from the worst effects of the financial turmoil circling the globe , according to u.s. and foreign officials assembling the program .   details of the u.s. contribution , which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees , have yet to be negotiated .   but several congressional leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration would have to act while congress is in recess .   this early warning from the administration reflects memories of how congress erupted with objections and hearings in 1995 when president clinton committed $ 20 billion in u.s. funds to the bailout of mexico .   but administration officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that members of congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic collapse in latin america that would resound in the united states , and thus they expect few objections .   the timing of an aid package for brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the brazilian government .   the government of president fernando henrique cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on sunday , which may well determine whether brazil can execute an austerity program that is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating with the international monetary fund .   the biggest role in the rescue program for brazil will be taken by the international monetary fund , which said last week that it would contribute at least $ 15 billion _ and appears to be under pressure from the united states to do even more .   another $ 9 billion or so will come from the world bank and the inter-american development bank , and the remainder from the united states and other major industrial nations .   germany and japan , though , have been reluctant to take part , one u.s. official noted , suggesting that latin america is chiefly washington 's problem , not their own .   so far , u.s. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to brazil .   `` brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region , the united states and the international community , and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful , '' treasury secretary robert rubin said on friday .   but in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil , rubin declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with brazil 's problems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the united states might contribute .   but he discussed brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that president clinton advocated in speeches to the imf and the world bank here three weeks ago .   at the time , clinton argued that the monetary fund should `` provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion '' rather than wait for disaster to strike .   direct u.s. aid to brazil would clearly send a symbolic message : that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund , the united states is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for brazil but to stop chaos spreading to argentina , mexico and other countries that are major u.s. trading partners .   that would be a change of strategy .   so far , the united states has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions , chiefly the imf but it would also be a risky move for president clinton , economically and politically .   even though congress objected to the $ 20 billion in u.s. funds committed to the bailout of mexico , it turned out that only $ 12 billion was ultimately needed , and it has since been paid back , with interest .   but rubin noted on friday that `` it 's a very different environment now . ''   other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in congress to direct u.s. participation in a brazil bailout .   `` i think there are a lot more people in congress who are now scared to death by what 's been happening in the markets , and what could happen in their own districts , '' a white house official said last week , `` and they wo n't say much as long as they do n't have to vote on it . ''   by acting soon to stabilize latin america , the administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed russia and , at its height , led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from brazil , for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency .   whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since thailand 's currency crisis in july 1997 is a matter of considerable debate .   but many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world : two successive interest-rate cuts in the united states , japan 's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $ 500 billion in taxpayer funds , and a steady strengthening of currencies in thailand , indonesia and south korea , the first signs that investors may be preparing to return .   always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets , rubin acknowledged that `` in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant , positive developments . ''   but the former trader , burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies , warned that `` serious issues remain '' and that `` it will take some time for the world to work its way out '' of what he has repeatedly called `` the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years . ''   in fact , rubin 's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic , which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets .   `` brazil and japan are the two obvious tinderboxes , '' said jeffrey garten , dean of the yale school of management , who served as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during clinton 's first term .   `` in brazil , the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem .   and in japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money . ''   but after spending 18 months in negotiations with the japanese , rubin clearly senses that the united states has little leverage in tokyo ; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock , not lack of resources .   in brazil , though , the united states has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program , as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to cardoso and his team .   but demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the exchange stabilization fund , created during the roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar .   the money is under rubin 's control , with presidential approval , and he reached into it to circumvent congressional objections to aiding mexico in 1995 .   but the reaction was so strong _ for a time congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts _ that rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since .   he committed $ 3 billion in a `` second line of defense '' in emergency aid programs for indonesia and south korea last year , but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country .   u.s. officials said that south korea did not need the extra help , and that the collapse of the suharto government in indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct u.s. aid .   in the bailout of russia _ whose economy collapsed after president boris yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformers _ the united states offered no direct help .   those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging markets , and greatly worsened brazil 's troubles .   so far , brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the imf , convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country .   but at the same time , the brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get it .   u.s. officials and top officials of the imf are clearly nervous , worried that the longer the negotiations drag on , the greater will be the risk of brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil .   `` the brazilians want everyone to think that it 's all under control , '' said an investment banker involved in the talks .   `` but the fact is that there 's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the government is going to be forced to devalue '' its currency , which is pegged to the dollar , but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall .   to prevent a sudden devaluation , the brazilian government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent , choking off credit for most companies .   meanwhile , the country is slipping into recession .   the aid would buy time for the brazilians , but it is contingent on cardoso 's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits , chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending .   the first deputy managing director for the international monetary fund , stanley fischer , spent friday in brazil to review the country 's austerity plan , which is expected to be announced after sunday 's elections but before the international package , to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to brazil .   `` brazil has to do a lot , '' fischer said last week before leaving on his trip .   `` in return , i expect the international community will make a large contribution .

a south korean lawmaker said friday communist north korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities than already feared .   without naming his source , rep. kim deog-ryong of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee said he had `` information '' that two underground facilities captured on u.s. spy satellite photos may be nuclear plants .   he said in a parliament session that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004 .   if true , the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected north korean nuclear activity than already made public .   kim said he asked the government 's unification ministry about the issue earlier this week and was suspicious of its answer .   `` it was not sufficient or sincere , so i came to suspect that the government is trying to hide the truth , '' kim said in a seven-page press release .   u.s. and south korean officials said in august they had detected a huge underground construction site on a mountainside 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) northeast of yongbyon , the country 's main nuclear complex .   the united states has said it suspects the construction is nuclear-related , though it has no evidence .   north korea has denied it .   kim , a lawmaker from the main opposition grand national party , said there may actually be two underground facilities not far from the yongbyon complex .   it was activity at yongbyon that prompted the united states to negotiate a 1994 accord promising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments if north korea would halt nuclear weapons development .   at the time , north korea was believed to have made enough plutonium for one or two atomic bombs .   the yongbyon complex , which houses a 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor , has been frozen under the 1994 accord .   kim said friday that one new facility is already operating and the other is under construction and will be operational in four to six years .   `` we estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003 , enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon within six to 12 months , '' kim said .   `` north korea would be able to make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every year after that . ''   north korea has said the underground construction is for civilian use and not nuclear-related .   it has offered to open the facility to u.s. inspectors , but says washington must pay compensation if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use .	s. korea says n. korea could be producing plutonium in underground plants .	south korean says north korea could be producing plutonium	north korea may be producing plutonium and has more underground facilities	south korea says north building two new nuclear sites ; operational by 2002 ?
it was not a voice mail message that dr. marilyn rymer , a neurologist in kansas city , mo. , would routinely delete , even as a registered democrat .   `` speaker newt gingrich 's office , '' it said , was calling to discuss a `` national leadership award . ''   dr. rymer has won acclaim as the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center , but this proposition seemed particularly grand .   when she returned the call , she said she was told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee to advise gingrich on legislation .   too good to be true ?   well , dr. rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually meet , and as an honorary committee chairman , she discovered , she would be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen .   and oh , the speaker wanted a donation of $ 500 to $ 1,000 to `` help our efforts , '' according to a transcript of a similar chat with another doctor , to elect a bigger republican majority in the house of representatives .   with the approach of the midterm elections next month , it turns out that the national republican congressional committee , which supports candidates for the house , has been sponsoring similar calls to tens of thousands of small-business owners , including doctors .   with this and other fund-raising programs , the committee says it has amassed $ 62 million for the elections .   but campaign finance watchdogs say the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising , one they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the publishers ' clearing house that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar windfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines .   by citing the speaker and promising celebrity and influence , they say , the calls are a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who might otherwise hang up .   dr. rymer says she was incensed .   so was dr. stanley turecki , a child and family psychiatrist in new york who votes as an independent and was also called .   `` i was absolutely outraged , '' he said .   `` anybody else who would do that would fall into the category of consumer fraud . ''   kenneth gross , a washington lawyer who specializes in election law and represents both democratic and republican clients , said , `` i have never heard of that particular device . ''   but it does n't appear illegal , he said , adding , `` it 's a fund-raising gimmick to get attention . ''   fred wertheimer , president of democracy 21 , a nonprofit , nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform , said , `` this is a new version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer beware . ''   when businesses do it , he added , congress orders investigations .   `` but this is n't going to be investigated because it 's members of congress who are doing it . ''   todd harris , a spokesman for the national republican congressional committee , said that he had not heard of any complaints and that there was no intent to deceive .   `` the national leadership award is a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment , '' harris said .   `` it 's part of bringing them into the process .   it 's important that they be recognized for the support they give the party . ''   `` there 's no quid pro quo '' that people solicited could receive awards for past contributions , he added .   what most peeves drs .   rymer and turecki is the message left with secretaries and answering machines invoking gingrich 's `` office '' and proposing the award .   they say they envisioned a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker 's chambers under the capitol dome .   the calls , however , are not placed by aides to gingrich , by any of his offices or by anyone in washington .   they are made by people with headsets and computers at the home of infocision management corp. , a telemarketing firm and congressional committee client in akron , ohio .   on its web page , infocision says its 1,400 employees operate 1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers .   `` every word in the script is approved by our clients , '' the company says on its web site .   `` every conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal . ''   besides telemarketing for businesses , said jamie blair , a supervisor at the center , `` we specialize in helping the republican party and conservative political groups . ''   however far they are from gingrich , the telemarketers are instructed to answer return calls with : `` republican congressional committee , newt gingrich 's office .   may i help you ? ''   a doctor in kansas city , mo. , who is a registered republican and who declined to be named , dialed the gingrich number ( 888-484-1644 ) left on answering machines and secretly recorded the ensuing discussion , which is legal in missouri .   `` we were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker , '' says a woman who picked up the call and identified herself as nancy .   `` he is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much as half , and he 's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains to a single rate of 15 percent . ''   to assure passage of the legislation , the speaker wants to increase his republican majority , she says , adding , `` to help us do that , the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals such as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on his advisory council . ''   nancy continues : `` there will be correspondence with the speaker , such as conference calls .   it 's a great way that he can get your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern you .   or maybe surveys or questionnaires . ''   later , nancy says : `` as a member of his committee , you would be receiving from the speaker our national leadership award , which is really quite an honor .   and to be honest , he will be asking each of our chairmen if they could help our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution of $ 500 or $ 1,000 .   `` now that would be used on the nationwide media campaign that newt has undertaken to target those seats we really need .   and as someone who i 'm sure would also benefit from this , could i tell the speaker he could count on your help ? ''   the doctor demurs .   `` i am a registered , you know , republican in kansas , '' she tells nancy .   `` probably if i were to do something it would be to go through my own representative . ''   then the doctor tries to ascertain where nancy is located .   `` is this congressman gingrich 's office that i 'm talking to ? ''   the doctor asks .   `` the speaker 's office , '' says nancy .   `` this is the speaker 's office . ''   `` that i 'm talking to , '' says the doctor , double-checking .   `` uh-huh , '' nancy replies .   the law prohibits political fund-raising calls from federal offices .   vice president al gore is under a justice department investigation for fund-raising calls he allegedly made from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign .   but the calls can be made from just about anywhere else , including campaign offices .   harris said the calls are `` in no way related to the speaker 's official office . ''   he added : `` what is more important is not where the calls get routed .   people are more interested in an award with the speaker 's good name on it than whether the call gets routed to washington or ohio .

the president of the yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let u.n. investigators probe alleged atrocities in kosovo .   in a letter to the united nations security council released wednesday by the tribunal , presiding judge gabrielle kirk mcdonald of the united states said the failure of yugoslav officials to grant visas to investigators is `` an affront . ''   `` the intentional and continuous refusal by the federal republic of yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal is an affront to the security council and all law-abiding nations , '' she said .   the texas judge fired off the letter last friday following the refusal of belgrade authorities to allow tribunal chief prosecutor louise arbour of canada and a team of investigators to visit kosovo .   mcdonald asked the security council to impose `` measures which are sufficiently compelling to bring the federal republic of yugoslavia into the fold of law-abiding nations . ''   hundreds of people , mostly ethnic albanians , have been killed , and as many as 300,000 driven from their homes since february , when serb forces began a crackdown on ethnic albanian separatists in kosovo .   the tribunal wants to look into allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict .	tribunal criticizes belgrade for refusing to comply with its obligations .	war crimes tribunal harshly criticizes belgrade for refusing un probe	belgrade refuses visas to investigators in kosovo atrocity probe	belgrade refuses to let war crimes tribunal investigators visit kosovo
american and allied forces in bosnia on wednesday arrested a bosnian serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment .   maj. gen. radislav krstic , arrested without incident in the american sector in northeast bosnia , is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far , and the first serving military officer .   he is accused of directing the attack on srebrenica in 1995 , one of the most chilling and influential events of the bosnian war , when some 7,000 bosnian muslim men were marched off , presumably to their deaths , as u.n. peacekeepers stood by .   the indictment of krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during and after the fall of srebrenica between july 11 and nov. 1 , 1995 .   he is indicted both in connection with `` direct personal involvement in the commission of these crimes '' as well as his command responsibility .   he is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity .   krstic was a colonel in 1995 , and the deputy commander of the drina battalion , but was promoted to general within days of the fall of srebrenica .   he is considered a close associate of the bosnian serb commander , gen. ratko mladic , and the former bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , both of whom are wanted by the tribunal .   and he is considered capable , if he is willing to testify , of implicating yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who has not been indicted .   louise arbour , chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , called krstic `` a very significant military leader '' and said she was delighted with the arrest .   the general was only indicted on oct. 30 , tribunal officials said , but the indictment was kept secret so there would be a better chance of a successful arrest .   nato secretary-general javier solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large `` should realize that they , too , will be brought to justice . ''   james rubin , the state department spokesman , said that the arrest `` serves as a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes , who remain at large , that they will be held individually accountable for their actions . ''   the bosnian serbs reacted angrily to the arrest , with the hardline bosnian serb president , nikola poplasen , saying that his government would now reduce contacts with nato-led peacekeeping forces `` to the necessary minimum . ''   poplasen , who defeated a more moderate candidate backed by washington in september elections , said the arrest of krstic had `` embittered and upset '' the bosnian serbs and would harm the implementation of the dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 bosnian war .   he said he would protest the arrest , and his remarks were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote .   a senior official of a nato country called the arrest `` very good news '' and said it was `` a warning to milosevic himself '' and others who have not been publicly indicted that `` the murders committed have not been forgotten . ''   a pentagon official said the arrest , the most important made in the american sector , `` was a sign that this is a continuing process . ''   nato-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , four of whom were the subject of sealed indictments .   there have been numerous calls for the arrest of mladic and karadzic , the two most infamous men indicted , but they normally are accompanied by armed guards .   nato forces have never tried to arrest them , apparently fearing casualties and an angry public reaction from bosnian serbs .   officials say that both mladic and karadzic are believed to have left the bosnian serb republic to live in serbia , which is part of yugoslavia and controlled by milosvevic .   krstic , who was transferred to the hague for trial , is the 35th suspect who has been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there .   he is the commander of the bosnian serb 5th corps and was arrested while traveling on the road to bijelina .   at the outset of the war in 1992 , he was an officer of the yugoslav army , and like all senior bosnian serb officers , was transferred to the new bosnian serb force .   in 1994 , he lost a leg in a mine explosion .   one bosnian serb official said in a telephone interview that , at the time , krstic had responsibility for `` anti-terrorist units '' who were given some of the most difficult tasks .   `` srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people do n't talk about it , '' the official said .   `` but everyone believes it was the anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing . ''   in banja luka on wednesday , some members of the bosnian serb parliament protested the arrest , saying that krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier .   ivo daalder , a former bosnia expert on the national security council , now with the brookings institution , said the arrest showed a new and promising coordination between the tribunal and nato troops , given the rapid arrest after the oct. 30 indictment .   he also said that the arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send an important message .   srebrenica was a key town in the bosnian conflict .   it was where the united nations first made a stand in march 1993 , when the commander of u.n. troops personally led a convoy of trucks to the surrounded town and promised the bosnian muslims there that srebrenica would be a `` safe area '' and the united nations would protect them .   but in july 1995 , the united nations did not protect srebrenica with air strikes , and peacekeeping troops watched as the serbs marched in , separated muslim men and women and marched the men off .   `` srebrenica signaled the massive failure of the west , '' said daalder .   `` it galvanized the united states and nato to act . ''   at a london conference later in july , nato agreed to defend gorazde and remaining safe areas with massive air strikes if necessary .   after a mortar attack on the sarajevo marketplace in late august , nato air strikes began , signaling the last chapter of the war and leading to the american-brokered dayton accords .   in sarajevo wednesday , an aide to the bosnian muslim member of the collective presidency , alija izetbegovic , praised the arrest .   `` we welcome this action , hoping very soon that the time will come for karadzic and mladic to be brought to justice , '' said the aide , mirza jajric .   the arrest took place as foreign ministers of the member countries of the organization for security and cooperation in europe met in oslo , norway , to discuss the international effort to keep the peace in kosovo , the southern serbian province .   under a deal pressed on milosevic in october , the organization will provide up to 2,000 civilians to monitor a cease-fire in kosovo and to promote a political settlement there to give kosovo enhanced autonomy .   macedonia 's government wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 nato troops near its border with kosovo .   those troops will be prepared to rush to the aid of the civilian monitors if necessary .	u.s. forces in bosnia arrest serb general accused of srebrenica genocide .	allied forces arrest bosnian serb general charged with genocide	serb general krstic highest military arrest .  directed srebrenica attack .	bosnian serb general , krstic , seized - war crimes tribunal charges genocide
armored personnel carriers were deployed tuesday around the convention center where u.s. president bill clinton will address 1,500 palestinian delegates next week .   u.s. secret service agents have already arrived in gaza to work with their palestinian counterparts on how to protect clinton during his first visit to palestinian areas .   `` there is cooperation with the american security people .   we have our own plan .   the americans have their own procedures as well , '' said the palestinian police chief , ghazi jabali .   the islamic militant group hamas , which hopes to scuttle the accord , has been careful not to openly threaten clinton .   however , hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in israel in an attempt to bring peace talks with israel to a halt .   on monday , clinton and palestinian leader yasser arafat are to address members of the palestine national council and delegates from other groups , at the shawa cultural center in gaza city .   traffic near the shawa center still flowed normally tuesday , but plainclothes security as well as uniformed officers with m-17 and ak-47 assault rifles began patrolling in the vicinity .   streets around the center are to be closed days before the clinton visit .   four armored personnel were parked at the corners of the convention center , with members of arafat 's elite bodyguard unit , known as force 17 , sitting on the vehicles .   apcs were also deployed outside arafat 's guest house and near the palestinian legislative council .   jabali said the apcs were part of a palestinian security plan that has been presented to the americans .   u.s. security agents , in turn , have given their palestinian counterparts sophisticated explosives detection equipment .   `` the palestinian police are ready to protect president clinton here in gaza or in bethlehem , '' jabali said , referring to clinton 's expected visit next tuesday to the church of the nativity in the biblical west bank town of bethlehem in jerusalem , clinton 's entourage of 1,200 people will take over the jerusalem hilton , at a cost of half a million dollars .   the hotel boasts stunning views of jerusalem 's walled old city and the slopes of the judean desert .	extra security ready for clinton 's gaza visit ; hamas has n't threatened him .	u.s. and palestine work out security plans for clinton 's visit to gaza	palestinian and us security high for clinton gaza visit .	extraordinary security for clinton in gaza , west bank ; radical hamas feared
premier romano prodi said monday he would appeal directly to parliament to save italy 's second-longest government since world war ii , threatened with collapse by the defection of its communist ally .   the address to parliament was expected wednesday , followed perhaps by friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether prodi 's 2 1/2-year-old , center-left alliance stands or falls .   prodi 's far-left ally , the communist refoundation party , provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget , which is key to italy 's participation in the european common currency .   prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the communists ' support .   `` i 've always acted with coherence , '' prodi said before a morning meeting with president oscar luigi scalfaro on the crisis .   `` i 've never changed strategy and i do n't want to do political gymnastics . ''   the break with prodi 's government divided refoundation .   armando cossutta , leader of the moderate wing , resigned as party president monday .   he said the party 's desertion of prodi was `` wrong and dangerous , '' but at the same time promised to follow the party line .   `` we are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead to early elections , '' cossutta told reporters monday .   `` and with the divisions in the left , this would mean a victory for the right . ''   if the crisis comes to a confidence vote and prodi loses , he would offer his resignation .   once he does that , it is up to scalfaro to decide what to do .   he could ask prodi or someone else to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early , something most analysts think unlikely .   working in prodi 's favor is the fact that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections , including the communist refoundation .   there was speculation prodi would reopen negotiations that would win back the communists ' grudging support , as he has managed to do in the past .   prodi 's government has held together this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of europe 's common currency , the euro .   that happened earlier this year _ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together .   prodi leads italy 's 55th government since world war ii .   he has outlasted all but bettino craxi , who served 3 { years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987 .   refoundation is not part of prodi 's center-left coalition , but the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower house .   it has been a difficult ally from the outset .   it broke with prodi over nato expansion earlier this year and on sending troops into albania last year .   prodi was even forced to resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro .   the crisis was resolved , and prodi returned to work , after he made steep concessions and promised a 35-hour work week .	prodi will go to parliament to save government ; cossutta quit as party pres	italy 's premier to appeal to parliament to save government	cutting deficit key to italy 's euro use .  cossutta quits as party president .	prodi , parliament , cossuta , scalfaro , euro , confidence vote , communist
premier romano prodi battled tuesday for any votes freed up from a split in a far-left party , but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week .   `` we must respect the will of the voters .   if we win the confidence vote , we will go ahead , otherwise we will pass the baton , '' prodi told a news conference closing a two-day french-italian summit in florence .   prodi 's center-left government , italy 's second-longest since world war ii , was threatened with collapse by the defection of its communist ally .   the premier will address parliament wednesday , followed perhaps by friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether the 2 1/2-year-old , center-left alliance stands or falls .   the communist refoundation party provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget .   but the break with prodi 's government divided refoundation .   armando cossutta , leader of the moderate wing , resigned as party president monday , saying the party 's hardline stance was `` wrong and dangerous . ''   prodi was hoping to profit from the break .   politicians have said prodi is now four votes short of the 316 votes needed for a majority in the chamber of deputies , the lower house .   the government has a majority in the senate even without refoundation 's support .   after his meetings with french leaders , prodi warned that the political difficulties threaten the progress the country is making in cleaning up its public finances .   prodi 's government has held together this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see italy qualify for the 1999 debut of europe 's common currency , the euro .   it qualified earlier this year _ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together .   as it is , prodi has outlasted all but bettino craxi , who served 3 { years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987 .   prodi 's is italy 's 55th government since world war ii .	prodi faces confidence vote ; break with prodi divides refounding party .	italian premier to resign if he loses pending confidence vote	confidence vote expected .  communist party divided .  euro hopes unified govt .	romano prodi said to be four votes shy of a majority in the lower house .

the european union wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostages in chechnya and said it would raise the issue with russia 's foreign minister .   in a statement , eu foreign affairs commissioner hans van den broek `` condemned in the strongest terms the senseless killing of the four hostages . ''   van den broek said the eu was determined to see remaining hostages in chechnya released unharmed .   he planned to discuss the killings with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , who is in brussels for talks at nato .   the severed heads of the hostages _ three britons and a new zealander _ were found tuesday .   the men , who were working to restore phone services in the breakaway russian republic , had been abducted by gunmen in october .	eu condemns slaying of 4 hostages in chechnya ; were telephone engineers .	european union condemns slaying of four foreign hostages in chechnya	european union condemns murders of 4 chechen hostages ; will talk to russia .	eu official condemns killing of four foreign hostages in chechnya
chechen police were searching wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them .   the deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by killers _ prompted neighboring russian regions to close off roads into chechnya , and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from russian and foreign officials .   chechen president aslan maskhadov said wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages , three britons and a new zealander .   but during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and decapitated the captives , maskhadov said , according to russian media reports .   `` a concrete criminal group was identified , an organizer of the abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages was determined , '' maskhadov said in a statement .   the severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway tuesday outside chechnya 's capital grozny , and hundreds of chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies wednesday .   `` we will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime , '' said maskhadov , who has been unable to restore law and order in chechnya since being elected last year .   the victims _ britons peter kennedy , darren hickey , and rudolf petschi , and new zealand 's stanley shaw _ were identified by their former bodyguard .   they had been abducted by unidentified gunmen oct. 3 in grozny .   `` he was just making a career for himself , '' hickey 's sister deborah , 21 , said wednesday , fighting back tears .   `` he was fantastic with electrics and all that sort of stuff .

opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions wednesday against prime minister mesut yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster .   yilmaz ' minority government could go down if the the small , center-left republican party , which usually gives him the majority he needs in parliament , votes against him .   the leader of the republicans , deniz baykal , urged yilmaz to resign .   but the premier vowed wednesday to stay on , saying he was the victim of a conspiracy .   `` this is a plot and it ca n't be a reason for a resignation , '' yilmaz said , adding that he intended to continue the `` struggle against organized crime . ''   afterward , baykal said the republicans would support a no-confidence motion .   the leader of the democratic turkey party , husamettin cindoruk , said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition .   he said the party would announce its decision thursday .   the political turmoil sent the istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent .	no-confidence motions lodged against prime minister yilmaz ; urged to quit .	yilmaz urged to resign , cows to stay and continue fight against crime	no confidence vote against yilmaz , who claims he 's victim of conspiracy	turkish prime minister losing small party backing ; may fall ; denies charges
bulent ecevit , who was asked to form a new government wednesday , is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home .   the invasion , after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with greece , has led to the division of the island .   throughout the years , ecevit , 73 , has remained a strong defender of the cause of the turkish cypriots `` as long as turkey lives , we wo n't allow the oppression and subordination of turkish cypriots at the hands of greek cypriots , '' he said in july 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion .   ecevit , who was prime minister three times since 1974 , has over the years shed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in the 70s .   during his tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month government that was toppled last week over a corruption scandal , he gave his backing to the liberal policies of the center-right-led coalition .   he often said he was carrying out a duty to bring a stable government and spare turkey from crisis - a reference to tensions between a previous islamic-led government and the secular military .   though never a marxist , ecevit was in his early years viewed with suspicion by big business for espousing socialism based on heavy government social benefits and a strong role for the state sector in the economy .   recently , however , he has helped the government keep on good terms with the imf , which ordered a strict curb on public spending , and approved a number of state sell-offs .   under his leadership in the 70 's , ties with the united states were tense .   he has also expressed concern over a u.s.-led multinational force based in turkey that monitors a no-fly zone over kurdish-controlled northern iraq .   he argues it it is helping create a kurdish state .   his frequent visits to iraq to meet with president saddam hussein have in turn raised suspicion in washington .   despite a short alliance with an islamic party in 1974 , he is a staunch defender of turkey 's secular traditions and pushed for a crackdown on islamic radicalism .   ecevit was born in istanbul in 1925 , to an intellectual family and studied literature at a prestigious american-run high school .   he has taken some courses at harvard university .   a former journalist , he entered politics in 1957 , rising to the leadership of the republican people 's party in 1972 , becoming prime minister in 1974 , briefly in 1977 and again in 1978-79 .   he was barred from politics in the years that followed a 1980 military coup .   he was imprisoned three times for carrying on with political activities despite the ban , mainly through his wife of 51 years , rahsan , who formed the democratic left party in 1985 and led it until a democratic reform in 1987 allowed ecevit back into politics .   in corruption-tainted turkish politics , he remains known as the leader with the cleanest slate .   not even his alliance with yilmaz who was ousted for alleged ties to the mob and rigging the privatization of a bank , tarnished his image .	ecevit asked to form new government ; former prime minister invaded cyprus .	former prime minister ecevit asked to form new government	bulent ecevit , honest , former pm , current deputy pm , to form new gov't .	ecevit asked to form turkish govt ; long and varied career ; cyprus , kurds .
premier-designate bulent ecevit said thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces in a secular coalition .   ecevit , who was asked to form a new government wednesday , desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier tansu ciller 's center-right party .   ecevit , a veteran leftist , already has the support of another center-right party led by mesut yilmaz , whose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal .   mrs. ciller has not said if she would back an ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry with yilmaz makes ecevit 's job of coalition-building difficult .   `` i do n't give up that easily , neither do i lose hope that easily , '' ecevit told his parliamentary group thursday .   mrs. ciller could lose grassroot support if she stands in the way of a new government , political columnist ertugrul ozkok wrote thursday in daily hurriyet .   `` this could put her at odds with her classic support base . ''   ecevit was expected to meet with yilmaz on thursday , and other party leaders friday .   turkey 's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the islamic virtue party out of power .   virtue is the largest party in parliament , but the all-powerful military is fiercely opposed to an islamic-led government .	ecevit tries to win support of ciller , needed to form secular coalition .	ecevit seeks support of center-right party in effort to form new government	secular parties trying to exclude virtue .  ecevit has yilmaz , luring ciller	ecevit fights to form coalition , secular , government and please military .
after failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition , premier-designate bulent ecevit announced saturday that he was returning his mandate to the turkish president .   in a statement reported by the anatolia news agency , ecevit said he would see president suleyman demirel monday morning .   ecevit , a veteran leftist , was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after mesut yilmaz ' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in parliament .   deputies accused yilmaz , who has since been serving as acting premier , of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank .   refusing any alliance with the pro-islamic virtue party , turkey 's largest party in parliament , ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature .   ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one led by yilmaz , the other by former prime minister tansu ciller .   ecevut 's alternate efforts to make a minority coalition with outside backing for his democratic left party from parliament also failed .   demirel will now have to either ask someone else to try to form a government or wait until jan. 10 , when the constitution allows him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to parliamentary elections , now scheduled for april .   such a cabinet would not have to face a confidence vote .   or demirel could choose to leave the current caretaker government , headed by yilmaz , in power until the elections .	ecevit fails ; turkish president to ask another or wait to appoint cabinet .	ecevit , unable to form coalition government , will return mandate	ecevit returns gov't forming job to president rather than include virtue	ecevit quits ; turkish president now must ask someone else or name caretaker
president suleyman demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form turkey 's next government , after a veteran politician abandoned efforts monday to persuade bickering political leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition .   bulent ecevit of the democratic left party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of votes in parliament .   `` it is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence , '' former premier mesut yilmaz said after talks with demirel .   `` we have told the president that we will not hamper the appointment of a deputy of parliament . ''   with party leaders unable to overcome differences , the new premier-designate would most probably be affiliated to a party but be trusted enough by other parties to follow an independent line .   parliament speaker hikmet cetin has been suggested as a likely candidate .   the new appointment would be made within days , yilmaz told reporters .   demirel consulted turkey 's party leaders immediately after ecevit gave up .   most declared themselves in favor of a government led by a lawmaker .   only center-right leader tansu ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader , and made clear she was willing to take on the task .   turkey 's parliament is split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right parties .   yilmaz led the last government , which collapsed in november amid allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with the sale of a state bank .   by tradition , demirel should then have asked the leader of parliament 's largest party to form a new government .   but demirel broke with custom to keep the islamic-oriented virtue party from power .   turkey 's staunchly secular military opposes the return of an islamic-led government .   modern turkey has had only one islamic-led government , formed after 1995 elections , and the military pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country 's secular traditions .   ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the virtue party during his efforts to form a government .	president 's next premier-designate likely to be widely trusted lawmaker .	president demirel seeking new candidate to form new government	ecevit fails 3-wk try to form majority .  long left-right split in parliament	speaker of turkish parliament likely to form government ; islamic party out .
james kopp , the man the fbi is seeking as a material witness in the sniper slaying of dr. barnett slepian , is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester , and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics .   the portrait that emerges of kopp , 44 , from police records , studies by researchers on right-wing movements , newspaper accounts of protests , and abortion rights advocates , is that of an itinerant protester , moving about the country in a series of increasingly abrasive protests at abortion clinics .   federal law enforcement officials say he is not currently a suspect in the slepian shooting , and there was no indication wednesday that he had been arrested for any violent acts .   at several abortion protests , he was charged with trespassing or resisting arrest , according to news accounts .   one of his arrests was in atlanta during operation rescue 's huge anti-abortion protests there in 1988 .   while he was in an atlanta jail , kopp was given the nickname atomic dog , which investigators contend links him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement , responsible for a series of bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers like slepian over the last five years .   responsibility for some of the violence _ like the bombing of an abortion clinic in birmingham , ala. , earlier this year , in which an off-duty policeman was killed _ has been claimed in notes signed by a shadowy `` army of god . ''   an underground manual issued in the name of the army of god , which describes methods for attacking abortion clinics , including how to make homemade c-4 plastic explosives , begins with a tribute , by nickname , of a clandestine band pledged to stop abortions .   the first name under this `` special thanks '' section is atomic dog .   the atlanta police , after searching the hundreds of arrest records of the protesters from the summer of 1988 , confirmed wednesday night that the date of birth and social security number of the james kopp arrested then matched those given out wednesday by the fbi task force in buffalo investigating the murder of slepian , who was gunned down through the window if his home in suburban amherst on oct. 23 .   at the nondescript frame house in st. albans , vt. , that the fbi gave as kopp 's last known address , the current resident , who gave his name only as e. kenny , 20 , a shipping clerk , remembered kopp well .   he lived there for part of 1990 as the guest of kenny 's parents , who were active in the anti-abortion movement , among a group of protesters who tried to shut down two abortion clinics in burlington in stubborn demonstrations that year .   kenny remembered kopp as a `` really nice guy , '' who did chores around the place but paid no rent to the parents .   he sometimes made wooden toys or played video games with kenny , then a child .   `` but the focus of his life was the anti-abortion movement , '' kenny recalled .   `` he was known among these people as atomic dog .   it was n't like a name that he had to go to the store or something .   but if you knew anything about him , that 's what you called him . ''   roughly 95 people were arrested during the protests , according to newspaper accounts at the time .   `` there were many , many arrests , '' recalled allie stickney , the president of planned parenthood of northern new england .   `` it was very big for vermont .   there were kryptonite locks and leaflets from the army of god and the lambs of christ .   it was clearly a highly organized blockade . ''   according to newspaper accounts , kopp was arrested outside a clinic in levittown , long island , in 1991 .   the protests in atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point for a hard-core group of protesters .   the atlanta police cracked down hard and carted hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated prison dormitory the called `` the farm . ''   operation rescue had mounted a series of blockades to close down abortion clinics in new york and philadelphia that spring .   atlanta was their high point , but in the face of the tough arrest policy , the movement faltered , split apart and stalled .   `` it was a traumatic , life-changing experience , '' said frederick clarkson , author of `` eternal hostility , '' a book on the anti-abortion movement , adding that by 1993 with the shooting of dr. david gunn , an abortion provider in florida , some of those in the atlanta jail became the nucleus of a group signing a `` justifiable homicide '' statement that declared that the use of force was warranted to `` defend the life of an unborn child .

some conservatives sounded notes of discord friday over the federal spending agreement , but they also said they would probably vote for the $ 500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers .   however , no one can vote on the package just yet , because it is not finished .   the deal that president clinton and republican leaders hailed thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $ 1.7 trillion budget , not a written document .   that is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees and their aides , who said friday that there were still disputes that needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more than 3,000 pages .   for example , still unresolved is a dispute over whether airlines can create a `` peanut-free '' zone to protect passengers who are allergic to peanuts .   house speaker newt gingrich and other members from georgia , a major peanut-producing state , are fighting the proposal , which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three rows of someone with an allergy .   congress gave itself until midnight tuesday to vote on the final bill , agreeing with president clinton to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government open .   the budget was due oct. 1 , the start of the new fiscal year .   the vote was initially expected friday , but the bill is nowhere near to being written .   only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including gingrich , senate majority leader trent lott and white house chief of staff erskine bowles _ were in the room for the final deal .   excluded were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees , who now must write the language that will put the deal into law .   almost everyone on capitol hill expects the budget to pass eventually , with the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the $ 20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies and for the package 's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut .   the lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further expand a bill they already consider overly bloated .   and some worry that once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly revealed , voters could put pressure on members not to support it .   the elections are nov. 3 .   but several conservatives said that despite these problems , they expected to support the bill anyway .   rep. mark souder , r-ind. , said : `most of my friends , who are predominantly activist conservatives , are split about 50-50 .   if tax cuts were your primary thing , then you 're unhappy , but many conservatives have a mixed agenda .   my position is , hold the nose and vote yes .   we have no tax cuts and far too much spending that i oppose , but that 's the nature of compromise .   every member has a little different focus . ''   souder said he liked the extra money for defense spending , and he liked the price supports for farmers .   hog farmers in his district , whose biggest customers were japan and china , had been hit hard by the collapse of asian markets .	despite some disputes , final budget approval only awaits drafting	broad budget outlines , 5th temporary funding extension agreed to	broad agreement on $ 1.7 trillion budget ; conservatives least happy .	republican congressional leaders and president reach budget agreement

a cabinet minister and a close syria ally on wednesday criticized the syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president , and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post .   walid jumblatt , the minister for displaced persons , said he and his party 's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member parliament elects the president , likely sometime before oct. 23 .   although a boycott by jumblatt 's progressive socialist party will hardly spoil the chances of gen. emile lahoud , it could embolden others to express discontent at the choice and the process of his election .   lahoud is virtually assured of the job : the prime minister and the parliament speaker first approved lahoud , who then won the all-important backing of syria , the main power broker in lebanon .   `` historically , we do not approve that a military man takes control of the country , '' jumblatt told reporters after a meeting with outgoing president elias hrawi .   although opposition to syria 's hold on lebanon 's politics is common among anti-syrian politicians , it is rare for somebody like jumblatt to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by syrian president hafez assad who keeps 30,000 troops in lebanon .   like jumblatt , some in lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence agents will track civilian life just as they did between 1958 and 1964 during the presidency of fouad chehab , the only other army commander to become head of state .   in nominating lahoud , `` rules were not respected , '' jumblatt said .   `` things were supposed to run in a more democratic way , '' said jumblatt , whose druse militia fought christian forces during the 1975-90 civil war .   the new president must be sworn in on nov. 24 , the day hrawi leaves office after a six-year term .   jumblatt said `` there is adequate political diversity and competition in the country , '' implying that choosing a military man for president was unnecessary .   deputy prime minister michel murr sought to calm fears about military intrusion .   he told reporters that lahoud will `` keep the army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army . ''   lahoud , a 62-year-old naval officer , enjoys wide public and political support at home and has good relations with syria .   he gained public admiration for reuniting an army fractured by civil war and in ending the reign of militias .   many hope he will cleanse the government of nepotism and wastage of public funds .   lahoud 's nomination complies with a tradition that the president be a maronite christian , the prime minister a sunni muslim and parliament speaker a shiite muslim .   the government is run by the joint efforts of the three officials .   jumblatt said his party will also boycott a parliamentary session to amend the constitution so that senior public servants can run for president .   criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of catholic bishops on wednesday .   nevertheless , the bishops welcomed the choice of lahoud , a fellow catholic , a statement said .	cabinet minister criticizes choice of military man for lebanon 's president	walid jumblatt opposed to a military president , fears civilian surveillance	lebanon : some oppose army commander as next president ; fear of militarism .	jumblatt , progessive socialist party , lebanon , vote , president , oct. 23
trying to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigners , china sent a respected labor rights activist from jail into u.s. exile sunday even as it prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial .   xu wenli 's trial monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate voice .   he is the third and most influential leader in the china democracy party tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned .   for organizing the party and thereby challenging the ruling communist party , xu , 55 , is accused of subverting state power , a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison .   to prevent supporters from rallying outside beijing 's no .   1 intermediate people 's court , police detained two of xu 's colleagues sunday and kept watch on the homes of at least two others , friends and a hong kong-based rights group reported .   as police moved against xu 's friends , labor rights campaigner liu nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside beijing and , with his wife and daughter , was put on a plane to canada and then new york , his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years .   authorities released liu on medical parole five months before the end of his sentence provided he go abroad , said his brother , exiled democracy campaigner liu qing .   his wife claimed for two years that liu 's health was worsening .   but only last month did authorities grant a comprehensive exam .   doctors found tumors , perhaps cancerous , in the 50-year-old 's mouth , stomach and bowels , liu qing said .   the timing of liu 's exile and xu 's trial was the most brazen in a string of high-profile dissident releases calculated to influence western governments .   human rights groups immediately denounced liu 's release as cynical and manipulative .   `` the chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no true commitment to international human rights standards , '' said xiao qiang of human rights in china , a new york-based lobbying group that liu qing heads .   over the past two years , as china tried to woo the west , beijing signed two key u.n. rights treaties and won praise for bringing its spotty legal system closer to international standards .   the ruling communist party relaxed some controls on dissenting views among academics .   xu wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in the more open atmosphere .   over the past six months , dissidents in 14 provinces and cities have tried to use chinese laws to set up and register the china democracy party .   in a sign of the opposition party 's appeal , 205 dissidents from across china issued a petition sunday calling for the immediate release of xu and two other leaders , the hong kong-based information center of human rights and democratic movement in china reported .   to wipe out the opposition movement , authorities have violated recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the rights of criminal suspects .   they rushed xu and fellow leader qin yongmin to trial with less than four days notice given to their families , instead of the 10 required by law .   qin and a third principal organizer , wang youcai , were also denied legal counsel .   police detained or scared off prospective lawyers , forcing the two to argue their own defenses in separate trials on thursday .   no verdicts have been announced .   the beijing court appointed xu a lawyer , but his wife , he xintong , suspects it is merely a formality in what she expects to be a show trial .   `` he has n't even read the whole indictment .   how is he going to represent my husband ? ''   he xintong said after talking with the lawyer and his aide .   authorities have turned down requests by xu 's colleagues to attend the trial , and he said she has been given one pass , for herself .   xu edited an influential dissident journal in the democracy wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison , most of them in solitary confinement .   since his parole ended last year , xu has played the role of elder adviser to dissidents .   he became openly involved in the china democracy party in november , organizing the group 's branch in beijing and nearby tianjin .   shortly before his arrest , he called on party members and exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress .	china exiles rights campaigner to u.s. to soften trial of noted dissident	china trying dissident , 3rd in 3 weeks , in violation of new rights law .	china : 3-week campaign against dissenters ; one exiled to appease west .	china , democracy party , communist party , subverting state power , trial
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who drew china 's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident wei jingsheng , said china 's sentencing of two dissidents monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed .   `` the reaction of chinese authorities is totally unacceptable , '' fischer said , calling for the dissidents ' immediate release .   `` the accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly , which are guaranteed by china 's constitution , '' and by the united nations ' international covenant on civil and political rights which china recently signed , fischer said in a statement .   chinese courts sentenced dissidents xu wenli and wang youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political party .	german foreign minister says china 's arrest of dissidents is unacceptable	german foreign minister calls china 's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable	german minister calls china 's jailing of two dissenters `` unacceptable .

the trials of three outspoken dissidents over , communist party leader jiang zemin signaled wednesday that china will sustain a crackdown on dissent throughout next year .   in his second hard-line speech in six days , jiang vowed to crush any challenges to communist party rule and preserve social stability .   he demanded that officials `` talk politics '' _ a euphemism for following party orders .   the speech , to senior law enforcement officials , used uncompromising language heard less frequently over the past 18 months as chinese leaders sought to improve relations abroad .   jiang 's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions for subversion this week of three political critics who tried to form an opposition party .   to underscore the party 's intolerant mood , national newspapers ran brief accounts tuesday and wednesday of the 13- , 12 and 11-year prison terms given to xu wenli , qin yongmin and wang youcai .   dissidents are rarely mentioned by official media , and the reports served as a warning to china 's 1.2 billion people .   in the speech , reported by state television , jiang said stability was crucial over the next year .   he noted two key events on the political calendar : the 50th anniversary of communist party rule on oct. 1 and china 's recovery of the portuguese colony of macau on dec. 20 .   `` we must strengthen the ideological and political education of officials and raise their awareness of and resistance to the sabotaging acts of hostile domestic and foreign forces , '' china central television quoted jiang as saying .   `` whenever any element that undermines stability raises its head , it must be resolutely nipped in the bud . ''   jiang did not exclusively target political enemies .   he likened their threat to that of white-collar and ordinary criminals and ticked off a list of potentially volatile problems _ inefficient state industries , legions of laid-off workers , stagnating farmers ' incomes and corrupt officials .   the emphasis on stability and warnings to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent of party pronouncements in the waning years of jiang 's mentor , deng xiaoping .   after deng died in 1997 and jiang emerged victorious from a major party conclave , he projected a more confident image .   reform , not stability , were the bywords of the past year .   academic debates over the past year were the boldest in 10 years by china 's relatively controlled standards .   party leaders too touted efforts to build a more comprehensive , predictable legal system and won praise from western governments for signing u.n. rights treaties .   `` our active developments of foreign affairs has reached new achievements , '' jiang said .   `` our country 's stature has risen a step higher . ''   by arresting and convicting xu , qin and wang in less than three weeks , china trampled its own legal safeguards for criminal suspects and raised questions about its commitments to u.n. rights treaties it signed over the past 15 months .   despite the swift punishments given the three , dissidents have continued to campaign for justice .   four elder members of the dissident community sent a letter to u.n. secretary-general kofi annan and u.n. human rights commissioner mary robinson calling on china to stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners .   `` we have experienced extreme disappointment , worry and shock '' over the long sentences given xu , qin and wang and the recent detentions of several other chinese , the four wrote in a letter dated tuesday that was released by new york-based human rights in china on wednesday .   in addition , 214 dissidents in china planned a 100-day series of rotating 24-hour fasts beginning thursday to protest the sentences , the information center of human rights and democratic movement in china reported wednesday night .   the fasts were to have begun with lawyer wang wenjiang , whom authorities prevented from representing wang youcai , and wang zechen in liaoning province in northeastern china , but the two activists were detained by police wednesday evening , the hong kong-based center said .   the british ambassador in beijing , tony galsworthy , and others delivered a protest message to the chinese government demanding the immediate release of xu , qin and wang , the foreign office in london confirmed on wednesday .   it was conveyed on behalf of the european union , the united states , canada and norway .	president jiang vows to crush any challenges to communist party rule	hard-line speech , publicized dissident sentences , signals chinese crackdown	china renews crackdown on political activists ; 3 jailed ; population warned .	jiang , hard-line , xu , qin , wang , stability , deng , u.n. rights treaties
